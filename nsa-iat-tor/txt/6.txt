S/lREL) In the case of Tor. TLS
SI/REL) Make deep packet inspection (XKS :-) ) work harder
S/IREL) Both use work of a open source project (brI/obfuscated-openssh)
Idea is both sides transmit random seed and veriﬁer information
(SI/REL) Veriﬁer is hash of seed and other data
(S/IREL) If verifier passes data used from both side seeds to generate key _ ..
(S/lREL) Key used in symmetric cipher to encrypt native SSH or SSL protocol
. (S/lREL) So for random stream, need to de-obfuscate and test for SSH/ SSL
