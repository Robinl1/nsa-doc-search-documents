Assurance (IA) relationship with CSEC is based on a 1986 Memorandum of r u reement. NSA
has a close, cooperative relationship with CSEC that both sides would like to ee expanded and
strengthened.

 

 
 

(SI/REL TO USA, CAN» CSEC is a highly valued second party partner. The r lationship is
driven by our mutual interest in the defense of North America as a whole. COoperative efforts
include the exchange of liaison ofﬁcers and integrees, joint projects, shared a-tivities and a
strong desire for closer collaboration in the area of cyber defense. Since Can oa has a limited
ability to produce cryptographic devices, it is a large consumer of US. lA prod cts.
