SURVEILLANCE | PERFORMING ARTS

 

Systems that log activities must be designed not to keep per-
sonal identifying data for very long, except when there is a prior
court order to keep the data about a particular person. We must
replace the advertising-based system for funding websites
with an anonymous method for paying to access a page.

To raise awareness of the issue, and invite the state’s
surveillance agents to search their consciences about what
they are doing, I now include the following note in most of
my outgoing mail:

“To any NSA and FBI agents reading my email: please con-
sider whether defending the US Constitution against all enemies,
foreign or domestic, requires you to follow Snowden’s example.”

Here I appeal to these agents in the name of their oath
of office. Snowden has demonstrated that surveillance
agents can understand that the Patriot Act is not the same as
patriotism; they can recognise their duty, and may have the
courage to act on it.

However, I do not expect large numbers of agents to follow
their consciences to oppose the wrongdoing of the state. To
stop that wrongdoing, we need to organise politically for
human rights, including privacy rights.
