The Snowden Files: British Spies Used Sex and 'Dirty Tricks'
Slideshow No. 2

These slides, from a top-secret spy conference in 2010, were
prepared by GCHQ, the British signals intelligence agency,
describing cyber operations and proposals for operations. The
slides focus on the efforts of a unit, the Joint Intelligence
Research Group, or J TRIG, and include a proposal to use foreign
journalists for intelligence operations.

The slides were leaked by former NSA contractor Edward
Snowden and obtained exclusively by NBC News, which is
publishing them with minimal redactions.
