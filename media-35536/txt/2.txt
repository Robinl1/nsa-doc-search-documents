(U) History

I (TS/ISIl/REL) The SCARLETFEVER development started in July 2009.
I (TS/ISIl/REL) The basic high level functional design was completed in
early September 2009.

(U) Design

(TS/ISI/IREL) The SCARLETFEVER team then met several times over the
July—September time frame to reﬁne the design of the system. The output of
those meetings was a series of BPMN diagrams and technology areas for
further investigation. The BPMN diagrams exposed:

I The ﬂow of information through the system (messages).
I The high level components and critical elements.

(TS/ISI/IREL) The messages, component and critical elements, and technology
areas were used to generate an initial list of Engineering Change Requests
(ECRs) for further reﬁnement and development.

(TS/ISI/IREL) SCARLETFEVER also has a geographically distributed
architecture concept which is currently being ﬂeshed out. Why is this being
pursued?

I Resume session pairing generates the bulk of the load. If this processing
can be shifted to the edge, then:
I Less total aggregated network traffic due to collaboration with the
core
I Less aggregate memory requirements at any one location
I Redundant capabilities for better total mission survivability
