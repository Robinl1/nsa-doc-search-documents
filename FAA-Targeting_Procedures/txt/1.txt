INFORMATION PURSUANT TO SECTION 702 OF THE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE

SURVEILLANCE ACT OF 1978, AS Aft/[ENDED

(S) These procedures address: (I) the manner in which the National Security A gency/Central
Security Service (NSA) will determine that a person targeted under section 702 of the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as amended ("the Act"), is a non—United States person
reasonably believed to be located outside the United States ("foreignness determination”); (II)
the post-targeting analysis done by NSA to ensure that the targeting of such person does not
intentionally target a person known at the time of acquisition to be located in the United States
and does not result in the intentional acquisition of any communication as to which the sender
and all intended recipients are known at the time of acquisition to be located in the United States;
(III) the documentation of NSA‘s f01 e1 gnness determination; (1V) compliance and oversight; and
(V) departures from these procedures.

I. (U) DETERMINATTON OE WHETHER THE ACQUISITION TARGETS NON-
UNITED STATES PERSONS REASONABLY BELIEVED TO BE LOCATED OUTSIDE
THE UNITED STATES

(S) NSA determines whether a person is a non-United States person reasonably believed to be
outside the United States in light of the totality of the circumstances based on the information
available with respect to that person, including information concerning the communications
facility or facilities used by that person.

(8) NSA analysts examine the following three categories of information, as appropriate under the
circumstances, to make the above determination: (1) they examine the lead information they
have received regarding the potential target or the facility that has generated interest in
conducting surveillance to determine what that lead information discloses about the person's
location; (2) they conduct research in NSA databases, available reports and collateral
information (i.e., information to which NSA has access but did not originate, such as reports
from other agencies and publicly available information) to determine whether NSA knows the
location of the person, or knows information that would provide evidence concerning that
location; and (3) they conduct technical analyses of the facility or facilities to determine or verify
information about the person's location. NSA may use infonnation from any one or a
combination of these categories of information in evaluating the totality of the circumstances to
determine that the potential target is located outside the United States.

(TS//Sl) In addition, in those cases where NSA seeks to acquire communications about the
target that are not to or from the target, NSA will either employ an Internet Protocol ﬁlter to
ensure that the person from whom it seeks to obtain foreign intelligence information is located
