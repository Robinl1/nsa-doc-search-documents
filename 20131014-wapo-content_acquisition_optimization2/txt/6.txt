Scenario: -@yahoo

° -@yahoo.com has a number of Yahoo groups in his/her
contact list, some with many hundreds or thousands of
members

- At DS-ZOOB in particular, collection spiked as:

The initial spam messages were sent (and collected)
lnboxes of email recipients were viewed by- contact list

Messages were sometimes viewed, but more often sent as precached
views on Google and Yahoo (along with inboxes)

lnboxes where the recipient did not delete the spam message continued to
be collected every time they were viewed

Some recipients added @yahoo.com to their address books
(possibly as a spam defeat?) — address books were collected every time
