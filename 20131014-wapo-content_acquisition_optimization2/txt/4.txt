Buddy Lists,lnboxes

 

- Unlike address books, frequently contain content data
— Offline messages, buddy icon updates, other data included
— Webmail inboxes increasingly include email content

— Most collection is due to the presence of a target on a buddy list where the
communication is not to, from, or about that target

- NSA collects, on a representative day, ~ 500,000 buddylists and
inboxes

— More than 90% collected because tasked selectors identified only as
contacts (not communicant, content, or owner)

- Identifying buddylists and inboxes without content (or without
useful content) an ongoing challenge
