(U) SOTF objects.

(U) Processing

(Cl/SI/IREL) Defragments fragmented sessions, creating an SOTF object with the
complete session.

(Cl/SI/IREL) Examines the BME to determine if the session should go to PWV.
(Cl/SI/IREL) Creates a new SOTF object, placing the received or defragged
SOTF object into the data section. The BME of the newly created object contains
classification metadata*, as well as certain fields such as sessionID and

signalUpTime replicated from the BME of the original received SOTF object.
* NOTE: Classification metadata needs more discussion to determine appropriate
origination. TURMOIL may assume some responsibilities.

(U) Determines appropriate routing (MAILORDER FDI) and forwards the new
SOTF object to EXOPUMP via MAILORDER.

(U) Optionally (configurable) wrap multiple objects destined for EXOPUMP/PWV
into one MAILORDER file to reduce the number of individual files transmitted.

(U) Outputs
