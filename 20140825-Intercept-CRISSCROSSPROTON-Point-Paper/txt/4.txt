o (S) PROTON allows a single stop to find registration information for phones
that are not being us ed by the person to whom they are registered. This is
particularly important for front companies, where tying multiple phones to
the same registration can provide critical information.”

(S) SID is recommending that a DNI IC-wide central communications metadata
repository be established and reside at NSA and that DIRNSA/CHCSS be made
Executive Agent for this IC repository. NSA and its foreign SIGINT partners stand
alone in conducting metadata analysis on such a large scale and as a result, our
tools and methodologies, as well as the infrastructure employed, are well tested and
have been proven efficient and effective. We already extensively share metadata
internally within the NSA/CSS enterprise and, having recently reached agreement
with our Second Party partners, are ready to begin implementing that agreement to
share Second Party metadata writ large.

(S/IN F) Rather than continuing to push communications metadata out to the
PROTON repository, we propose using the existing 10 shared information space
ICSIS (Intelligence Community System for Information Sharing) on INTE LINK and
have IC users come in through an existing tool to pull data from metadata
repositories resident at NSA. We would implement IC access to our
GLOBALREACH federated query service via accounts and access verified by PKI
certificates. This service will provide the access requested and permit the auditing
of such repository users. We believe we can have GLOB ALREACH capability ready
for the IC within approximately one to two months of a decision to proceed with this
proposal.
