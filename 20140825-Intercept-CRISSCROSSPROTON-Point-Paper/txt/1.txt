SUBJECT: CRISSCROSSKPROTON

PURPOS E: Provide DIRNSA information on subject.

BACKGROUND:

(U) History of CRISSCROSSXPROTON (how did it come about, when, and by
whom.)

(SNOC, NF) Project CRISSCROSS began in the early 1990’s when CIA and DEA
collaborated on a database and analytical tool suite to perform link analysis and
cross-reference lookups against DEA and CIA collected telephone billing records
and phone directories.

(SHOC, NF) NSA Office of Crime and Narcotics requested the software and
database capabilities of CRISSCROSS to enhance SIGINT data. CRISSCROSS
proved extremely successful at identifying new phone numbers associated with
‘lost' drug targets and locating additional targets of interest. Expanding the
coverage from Latin America to worldwide then enhanced target development
efforts across all NSA product lines.

(U) Current CRISSCROSSXPROTON Agreements.

(SHOC, NF) All CRISSCROSSXPROTON Agreements are via bilateral
Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) and exist between CIA, DEA, NSA, DIA,
and FBI. DEA and FBI do not currently share data with each other.

(SHOC, NF) DIA provides support to various DoD elements (e.g 'JICs/JACs and
other Service Intelligence structures) as specified in MOU Addendums.

(U) How current data in CRISSCROSSXPROTON is "minimized" and by what
standards.

(SNOC, NF) From its inception, NSA has only provided telephony data to
CROSSCROSSXPROTON , which constitutes: date, time, duration, called
number and calling number. NSA ‘minimizes” this metadata prior to its
transmission of data to CIA.

(Sf/NF) NSA data is pulled from the FASCIA and HOMEBASE systems and
transmitted to a NSA terminal in CIA’s PROTON Project Office.

(SKISI) For US. and 2nd party numbers, minimization is achieved by replacing
the rightmost 4 digits with four x’s.
