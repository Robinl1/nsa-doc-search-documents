3.1 Activity of Networks

Unique country codes identified in each of the time periods were correlated to produce the

Figure 3 - IMSIs identified with Ki data for Network Providers

This shows the number of IMSIs found with Ki data in each period for the providers shown,
portraying a steady rate of activity from several networks of interest. New Ki and IMSI pairs
are regularly seen for AWCC, TDCA and MTN.

A large batch of Somali Kis was recovered in mid—March using this automated process.
Somali providers are not on GCHQ’s list of interest, hence it is likely this item would have
been missed by manual collection, however this was usefully shared with NSA. A number of
other unexpected providers were brought to light including Babilon-Mobile in Tajikistan and
Icelandic provider Nova 3G.

This has demonstrated that an automated Ki recovery method can effectively identify IMSI
and Ki pairs from bulk C2C sources for key targets, with the added benefit of identifying
content that would not normally come to analyst attention. The chart presented provides an
overview of networks accessible in C2C repositories.
