The automated harvesting technique was used to extract IMSI and Ki values from bulk data
over a 3—month period. This was performed over six 2-week intervals. The resulting number
of IMSIs, Kis and associated statistics produced are shown in Table 1.

The technique can be seen to identify a steady stream of IMSI and Ki data over a period of
time. UDAQ item identifiers which contain the IMSI and Ki data can additionally be provided
to analysts allowing sources to be further investigated.

These results are further analysed in the following section:
