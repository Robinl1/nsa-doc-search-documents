2.1.1 Bulk Data Retrieval

ICTR provide a bulk data download capability using the research server
LLANDARCYPARK. This was used to automate the queryng of C2C content in UDAQ.
Given a standard SQL query wrapped in an XML form this will return a package containing
all matching C2C intercept.

A base query, a proximity search for the strings ‘IMSI’ and ‘Ki’, was used for this experiment.
This can be seen in Appendix 1. Date fields are marked with placeholders so these can be
automatically filled out using regular expressions at run time.

Results are returned as a compressed file containing a CCDF2 mesh. A routine was then
written to unpack this mesh, allowing results to be treated from then on as a set of plain text

files.

Scripts were developed to perform all steps of the operation automatically, retrieving
packaged data to be interpreted by the user (reference 6). This operates as follows:

The script JrunRemoteQuery.sh is used to launch the process. This:

0 Requests a date range to query
0 Rewrites the query XML file with required dates

 

1 Cryptologic Common Data Format. Details are described in reference 4.
