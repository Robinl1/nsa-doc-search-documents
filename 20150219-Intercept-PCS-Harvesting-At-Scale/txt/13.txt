Most of TDSD’s targeting effort is focussed on SIM suppliers and network operators, hence it

was expected that most associated addresses would fall into these categories.

Table 2 - Types of organisations associated with IMSIIKi traffic

Table 2 shows how often each type of organisation was associated with Ki traffic. Contrary to
expectation the vast majority of addresses seen belonged either to network operators or
hardware companies.

This could indicate increased use of strong encryption products amongst SIM suppliers,
leaving only the other groups open to this method of exploitation. TDSD may wish to ensure
that targeting for SIM suppliers is up to date, as well as investigating the possibility of
targeting hardware companies and network operators to improve results.

3.4 Comparison with present efforts

3.4.1 Manually collected Kis

A manual trawl of UDAQ data was performed against AWCC for the period between 28‘h
March and 10Lh April 2010. This was compared directly against results from an automated run
over the same period, not targeted against any particular provider.
