In the manual trawl 14 UDAQ items were identified, all containing 1 or more IMSI/Ki pair
for AWCC. The automated run found 12 UDAQ items, 3 of which had been identified in the
manual trawl. A summary of results is shown in Table 3:

Table 3 - Results of Ki I IMSI trawl

The manual search resulted in a total of 27 IMSI values for AWCC. The automated search
resulted in 320 values, 26 of which were from the AWCC network. The automated methods
also identified 10 unique IMSIs from Roshan and 83 from MTN Yemen (results 3 and 23).

It can be seen that the automated search missed the majority of manually recovered items.
Reasons for this are noted in the comments column: in all cases the string IMSI did not appear
in the results file, hence these items were not returned in the initial bulk query. The majority
of these items also had IMSI and Ki data split across multiple lines, meaning they would not
have been identified by the detection techniques employed in this work in any case. Both
techniques found comparable quantities of IMSIs for AWCC with the result sets being mostly
complimentary.

This has demonstrated that although the automated method is able to return a representative
set of items from bulk data, and often-larger volumes of Kis, it tended to miss items found
manually. More work is required both at the initial bulk query stage as well as with
processing and detection techniques.
