(TSALSWN-F) (OGC Attorney): Let's take a look at the BR Bulk Metadata Program. As we mentioned in Module 1, the BR Primary Order pertains specifically
to telephony metadata which is kept by U.S.-based telecommunications companies as part of their normal business operations. They retain this
information, in part, so they can send their subscribers a bill every month.

(TS#SI#NF) The business records include, for example, originating and terminating telephone numbers, International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI),
International Mobile Station Equipment Identity (IMEI), trunk identifiers, and telephone calling card numbers.
