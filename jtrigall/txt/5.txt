[edit] Effects Capability

JTRIG develop the majority of effects capability in GCHQ. A lot of this capability is developed on demand for specific operations and then further

developed to provide weaponised capability.

Don‘t treat this like a catalogue. If you don‘t see it here, it doesn‘t mean we can‘t build it. If you involve the JTRIG operational teams at the start of your

operation, you have more of a chance that we will build something for you,

For each of our tools we have indicated the state of the tool, We only advertise tools here that are either ready to fire orvery close to being ready

(operational requirements would re-prioritise our development), Once again, involve the JTRIG operational teams early.
