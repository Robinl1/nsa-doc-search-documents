We don‘t update this page anymore, it became somewhat of a Chinese menu for effects operations. Information is now available for JTRIG staff at [[119]

[edit] Understanding this page

Tools and techniques are developed by various teams within JTRIG. We like to let people know when we have something that we can think we can use,
but we also don‘t want to oversell our capability.

For this reason, each tool indicates its current status. We may put up experimental tools or ones that are still in development so you know what we are
working on, and can approach JTRIG with any new ideas. But experimental tools by their nature will be unreliable, if you raise expectations or make
external commitments before speaking to us you will probably end up looking stupid.

Most of ourtools are fully operational, tested and reliable. We will indicate when this is the case; however there can be reasons why our tools won‘t work
for some operational requirements (eg if it exploits a provider specific vulnerability). There may also be legal restrictions.

So please come and speak to JTRIG operational staff early in your operational planning process.
