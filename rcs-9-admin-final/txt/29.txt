What you should know about users and groups

Introduction

To guarantee maximum data conﬁdentiality and security, RCS provides the Administrator the
opportunity of assigning login privileges to each user and grouping users in workgroups for
specific operations. The structure adapts to both situations were tasks are highly fragmented and
situations where all tasks are perform ed by a few people.

By managing users, the Administrator can also quickly disconnect a suspected user and
temporarily disable hisf'her RC5 login.

Login privileges

RCS was designed to guarantee maximum server and collected data security. To achieve this goal,
four distinct roles were defined that usually refer to the professionals who can login to the system:

0 "1!! System administrator: exclusively in charge of hardware and software installation and
backups

0 “ﬂ Administrator: in charge of all system login, investigations and investigation goals

0 F Technician: in charge of setting up and installing tapping agents

0 04 Analyst: in charge of data analysis

‘ Tip: several roles can be assigned to the same user, for exam pl e, an Administrator can
also have Technician privileges.
