What happens when a target is created

When a target is created it is already declared open and thus the Technician can be asked to
generate and install agents.

What happens when a target is closed
A target can be closed, for example, when closing investigations for that target.

Closing a target automatically closes its agents. When an agent is closed, uninstallation occurs at
the first synchronization, leaving the device clean.

A closed target cannot be re-opened. Only the target data and those sent by agents are left in the
database.

I CAUTION: when a target is closed, all linked agents are automatically uninstalled. Only
close a target when certain to have all the required data.

CAUTION: for infrequent synchronizations, Jfor example, every Jfour days, wait for the last
' planned synchronization before closing the target.

. Tip: only close the target when you are sure that agents have downloaded all the required
information.

Opening and closing an operation

When an operation is closed, all of its targets are irreversibly closed and all their agents are
uninstalled. See "What you should know about operations” on previous page .
