(TSIISI/IREL) Only R&T Analysts can submit QUANTUMTHEORY Tasking to the
QUANTUM team. TOPI Analysts can submit QUANTUMNATION Tasking through
Target Profiler. The biggest difference is QUANTUMTHEORY deploys a stagel implant
called VALIDATOR (soon to be COMMONDEER) and QUANTUMNATION deploys a
stageO implant called SEASONEDMOTH (SMOTH). SMOTHs die within 30 days of
deployment unless requested to extend the life.

(TSI/SII/REL) This presentation does not cover FAA QUANTUM. but if you identify an
active selector, compare the SIGAD in Marina to the SIGAD on the GO QUANTUM wiki
page to see if FAA QUANTUM is an option.

(TSIISI/IREL) This presentation is geared towards targets seen at US- . If you are
unfamiliar with this SIGAD. it is equivalent to a TS/INF SIGAD that cannot be
mentioned in this PowerPoint. You can contact the POC of this brief for more
information.
