FAA Certification 2009—B - Counterterrorism

 

 

(Targeting Directed at Foreign Terrorist Groups)

 

Changes from 2008—B:

Exhibit F is updated

New method to update
Exhibit F target list

Some notifications are
changed from

“7 days” to

“5 business days”

This certification replaced certiﬁcation 2008-B. The list of
terrorist groups in Exhibit F is slightly different from that
which was included in the 2008 version. As always, if an
analyst wants to target a selector pursuant to this
certification, he should make sure that the targeting
concerns a listed terrorist group. NSA may modify the list
by notiﬁcation to the Attorney General and Director of
National Intelligence within 5 business days of
implementing collection directed at a group that does not
appear on the list, but that is not a decision that can be made
by an individual analyst. Questions about modifying the list
should be addressed to the OGC.

The only other somewhat significant difference between
2008-B and 2009-B is a change in the calculation of some
requirements for notiﬁcation which mirrors the change
made in 2009-A (discussed above). In 2008-B, NSA was
required to notify the AG and DNI of additions to the list in
Exhibit F within “7 days”. NSA was also required to
inform DOJ and the ODNI of certain incidents of
noncompliance with the targeting procedures as well as
inadvertent targeting of persons located inside the US
within “7 days.” All of these requirements have been
changed to “5 business days” in 2009-B to ensure consistent
calculation of the timeframes for notification.
