Minimization Procedures (Exhibit B)

These procedures differ in two relatively minor ways from the
minimization procedures for 2008-A and 2008-B. Both of
these differences appear in section 8. First, they make it clear
that NSA may disseminate intelligence reports that contain
properly minimized US person information to foreign
governments, and that any dissemination of US person
information to a foreign government must be done in a manner
consistent with subsections 6(b) and 7 of the minimization
procedures. . .essentially the same rules that govern
dissemination of US person information to other federal
agencies. Because NSA always interpreted this portion of the
minimization procedures in this manner, this “clarification”
has no meaningful practical consequences. Second, they
expand NSA’s capability to obtain technical and linguistic
assistance from foreign governments beyond the Second
Parties. The conditions and limitations under which such
assistance may be sought/provided remain unchanged, but as
long as they are met, NSA may obtain the assistance from
other foreign governments as well.
