Section 3 — Acquisition and processing

Highlights of section 3, which addresses acquisition and

targeting, prior to the determination that the
person’s status or location was incorrect, must
be handled in accordance with the procedures

believed to contain signiﬁcant foreign
intelligence shall be disseminated to the FBI,
