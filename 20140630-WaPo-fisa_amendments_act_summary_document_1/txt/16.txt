FAA Certification 2009-A - Foreign Governments

 

 

(Targeting Directed at Foreign Governments and Similar Entities)

 

 

Changes from 2008—A:

Exhibit F is updated

New method to update
Exhibit F target list

Some notifications are
changed from

“7 days” to

“5 business days”

This certification replaced certiﬁcation 2008-A. The list of
governments/entities in Exhibit F is slightly different from
that which was included in the 2008 version. As always, if
an analyst wants to target a selector pursuant to this
certification, he should make sure that the targeting concerns
a listed entity. NSA may modify the list by notiﬁcation to
the Attorney General and Director of National Intelligence
within 5 business days of implementing collection directed at
an entity that does not appear on the list, but that is not a
decision that can be made by an individual analyst.
Questions about modifying the list should be addressed to the
OGC.

The only other somewhat significant difference between
2008-A and 2009-A is a change in the calculation of some
requirements for notiﬁcation. In 2008-A, NSA was required
to notify the AG and DNI of additions to the list in Exhibit F
within “7 days”. NSA was also required to inform DO] and
the ODNI of certain incidents of noncompliance with the
targeting procedures as well as inadvertent targeting of
persons located inside the US within “7 days.” All of these
requirements have been changed to “5 business days” in
2009-A to ensure consistent calculation of the timeframes for
notiﬁcation.
