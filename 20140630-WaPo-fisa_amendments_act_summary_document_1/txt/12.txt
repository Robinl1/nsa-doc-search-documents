The foreign government groups that are the
subject of Certification 2008-A (Exhibit F)

The foreign governments, factions, foreign entities and
foreign based political organizations that are the subject of
Certification 2008-A (Exhibit F)

In 2008-A, the DN I and AG state that the foreign
intelligence information to be acquired pursuant to the
certification concerns foreign powers as defined in specific
parts of FISA. They also state that the entities listed in
Exhibit F ﬁt within these definitions. This means that NSA
can target individuals reasonably believed to be non-US
persons located outside the United States to acquire
information concerning these entities. If NSA wants to
target an individual who is reasonably believed to be a non-
United States person located outside the United States in
order to obtain information concerning a foreign power that
ﬁts within these deﬁnitions, but which is not on the list it
may do so. However, it must notify the AG and DNI within
5 days of implementing such targeting. The notification
must include a description of the factual basis for NSA’s
determination that the additional government, faction, entity
or political organization is a foreign power that ﬁts within
the speciﬁed deﬁnitions in FISA.
