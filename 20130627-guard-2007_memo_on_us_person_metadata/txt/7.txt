Three of the four deﬁnitions of electronic surveillance are satisﬁed only when the
communication is acquired “under circumstances in which a person has a reasonable expectation
of privacy and a warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes.” 50 U.S.C.
§ 1801(i)(1), (3), (4). This statutory expectation—of-privacy requirement adepts a term of art
from Fourth Amendment case law. See, e. g., Katz, 389 U.S. at 361 (Harlan, J., concurring).
“[W]here Congress borrows terms of art . . . it presumably knows and adopts . . . the meaning
[their] use will convey to the judicial mind unless otherwise instructed.” Morissette v. United
States, 342 U.S. 246, 263 (1952). The legislative history conﬁrms the applicability of this
presumption in this instance. It repeatedly adverts to constitutional standards when discussing
this provision. See, e. g, S. Rep. 95—701, at 37, 1978 U.S.C,C.A.N. at 4006 (noting that the
provision “require[s] that the acquisition of information be under circumstances in which a
person has a constitutionally protected right of privacy”); HR. Rep. No. 95—1283, at 53 (same);
S. Rep. No. 95—604, at 35, 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3937 (same). For the reasons stated above,
there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in the communications metadata at issue here;
therefore, NSA’S proposed activity would not come within the deﬁnitions of electronic
surveillance contained in subsections 1801(t)(1), (3) or (4). (S)

The fourth deﬁnition of electronic surveillance involves “the acquisition by an electronic,
mechanical, or other surveillance device of the contents of any wire communication . . . SO
U.S.C. § 1802(f)(2). “Wire communication” is, in turn, deﬁned as “any communication while it
is being carried by a wire, cable, or other like connection furnished or operated by any person
engaged as a common carrier . . . .” Id. § 1801(1). The data that the NSA wishes to analyze
already resides in its databases. The proposed analysis thus does not involve the acquisition of a
communication “while it is being carried“ by a connection ﬁlmished or operated by a common
carrier. (Sl/Sl)

Pen Register and Trap and Trace Provisions (U)

The pen register and trap and trace surveillance provisions of FISA, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1841—
1846, and of the criminal law, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3121~27, do not apply to the communications
metadata analysis that NSA wishes to conduct. (S//ST)

First, for the purpose of these provisions, “pen register” is deﬁned as “a device or process
which records or decodes dialing, routing, addressing or signaling information.” 18 U.S.C.
§ 3127(3); 50 U.S.C. § 1841(2). When NSA will conduct the analysis it proposes, however, the
dialing and other information will have been already recorded and decoded. Second, a “trap and
trace device” is deﬁned as “a device or process which captures the incoming electronic or other
impulses which identify the originating number or other dialing, routing, addressing and
signaling information.” 18 U.S.C. § 3127(4); 50 U.S.C. §184l(2). Again, those impulses will
already have been captured at the point that NSA conducts chaining. Thus, NSA’s
communications metadata analysis falls outside the coverage of these provisions. (S//Sl)
