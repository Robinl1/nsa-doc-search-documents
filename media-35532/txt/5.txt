TOP SECRET STRAPl
Sensitivities
° Cryptanalytic capabilities

— Are extremely difficult and costly to acquire
— Require along lead time

— Depend on sensitive sources

— Are very fragile

— If lost, may never be regained

° The mere “fact of" a capability is very sensitive:

— An adversary who knows what we can/cannot break is
able to elude our capabilities even without knowing the
technical details of how the capabilities work

PTD ”We penetrate targets' defences.”
