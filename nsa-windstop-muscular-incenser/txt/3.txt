Speaker’s Notes

From Feb 28 2013: Proposed/imminent latest DO/Volume reduction: Narchive

BLUF: Requested 52 concurrence at 52 TLC on 25 Feb with partial throttling of content from Yahoo, Narchive email traffic which
contains data older than 6 months from MUSCULAR. Numerous 52 analysts have complained of its existence, and the relatively
small intelligence value it contains does not justify the sheer volume of collection at MUSCULAR (1/4th of the total daily collect).

Background: Since July of 2012, Yahoo has been transferring entire email accounts using the Narchive data format (a proprietary
format for which NSA had to develop custom demultiplexers). To date, we are unsure why these accounts are being transferred —
movement of individuals, backup of data from overseas servers to US servers, or some other reason. There is no way currently to
predict if an account will be transferred via Yahoo Narchive.

Currently, Narchive traffic is collected and forwarded to NSA for memorialization in any quantity only from DS-2003. On any given
day, Narchive traffic represents 25% (1563) of DS-2003’s daily PINWALE content allocation (GOGB currently). DS-2003 is scheduled
to be upgraded in the summer of 2013; it is likely that memorialized Narchive traffic, if still present in the environment, will grow
proportionally (i.e. double now, to 30 GB/day).

Narchive traffic is mailbox formatted email, meaning unlike Yahoo webmail, any attachments present would be collected as part of
the message. This is a distinct advantage. However, it has not been determined what causes an Narchive transfer of an account, so
these messages are rarely collected ”live”.
