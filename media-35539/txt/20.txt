9K TOP SECRET STRAPl COMINT

 

Possible Exploits?

 

 

 

- Rendezvous Point (RP)
— What if we owned the RP?
— Traffic still encrypted, although only a single layer of encryption
— Still only content, don't know who the user is or where the H8 is located
— Clients randomly select their RP so unlikely to be picked anyway

  

- Hidden Service Directory (HSDir)

— If we take a HSDir down, there are still many left
— Could potentially collect onion domains if we acted as a HSDir

° Client
— No real way to distinguish between a Tor user accessing the web tg-E
