PROCEDURES FOR THE DISSEMINATION BY NSA
TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS OF INFORMATION FROM FISA ELECTRONIC
SURVEILLANCE OR PHYSICAL SEARCH CONDUCTED BY THE FBI

These procedures have been adopted pursuant to the modiﬁed minimization procedures
governing the analysis, retention, and dissemination by National Security Agency (N SA) of any
data received by NSA from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and acquired by the FBI
pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1811, 1821-1829
(FISA). Those modiﬁed minimization procedures have been adopted by the Attorney General
and are described in a motion approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court on July 22,
2002, and captioned “IN RE ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE AND PHYSICAL SEARCH OF
INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST GROUPS, THEIR AGENTS, AND RELATED TARGETS.”
Those modiﬁed minimization procedures state:

Nonpublicly available identity or personally identiﬁable information concerning United
States persons may be disseminated to foreign governments provided that:

(a) the information to be disseminated is foreign intelligence information; and

(b) the dissemination is approved by the Attorney General, or approved pursuant
to such procedures as the Attorney General may establish for the
dissemination of such information by NSA. (S)

To the extent authorized by the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and in accordance
with DCI directives, NSA may make such disseminations without speciﬁc Attorney General
approval subject to the following procedures: (S)

(1) Disseminations to the Governments of the Untied Kingdom, Canada, Australia, or New
Zealand may be made upon the approval of any person designated for such purpose by the
Director of NSA. (S)

(2) Disseminations to other foreign governments may be made upon the approval of the NSA’s
Ofﬁce of General Counsel, upon consideration of the following factors: the national security
beneﬁt the United States may reasonably expect to obtain from making the dissemination; the
anticipated uses to which the foreign government will put the information; and any potential for
economic injury, physical harm, or other restriction of movement to be reasonably expected from
providing the information to the foreign government. It the proposed recipient(s) of the
dissemination have a history of human rights abuses, that history should be considered in
