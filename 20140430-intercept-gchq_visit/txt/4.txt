PREVIOUS VISITS AND RESPECTIVE TOPICS: (U//FOUO) As General Alexander’s UK
counterpart, Sir Iain has visited NSA on several occasions, in both his current position and
previous ones. Sir Iain most recently visited NSA on 27 March 2012, when he accompanied Air
Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach. During that visit, Sir Iain met with General Alexander,

Mr. Inglis, and other NSA and USCYBERCOM leaders.

POTENTIAL LANDMINES: (TS//SI//NF) GCHQ has long advocated that it work with NSA
and the Israeli SIGINT Service (ISNU) in a tn'lateral arrangement in prosecuting the Iranian
target. SID policy has been opposed to such a blanket arrangement, and the speciﬁc tn'lateral
explained in the attached paper on Iran should not be interpreted as a broad change of approach.
In other areas, NSA and GCHQ have agreed to continue to share information gleaned from the
respective bilateral relationships with ISNU.
