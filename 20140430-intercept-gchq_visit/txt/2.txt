GCHQ’s court awaiting signature. With that said, GCHQ seems less enthused about
Triage, perhaps in part because of the long steps necessary to gain approval. For
additional background about these topics, see the attached paper that Mr.

SID Associate Deputy Director, Counterterrorism
(ADD/CT) SIGINTAuthorities Lead, NSA/CSS Counterterrorism Mission Management
Center ( CTMMC ) prepared for D/DIR’s April 2013 UK visit.

— (TS//SI//NF) UK Intelligence Community Oversight: GCHQ and its sister intelligence
agencies are challenged with their activities and operations being subject to increased
scrutiny and oversight from their government (and public). As a result, closer attention is
being paid to how UK-produced intelligence data is being used by NSA, and other
partners. It is possible that Sir Iain may ask about what safeguards NSA may be putting
in place to prevent UK data from being provided to others, the Israelis for instance, who
might use that intelligence to conduct lethal operations. For additional information about
this subject, and other UK Intelligence Community legal issues and legislation, see the
attached paper prepared by Mr. _ Oﬂice of the General Council, London.

— (TS//SI//NF) Syria: Prime Minister Cameron continues to look to the UK security and
intelligence agencies for recommended courses of action to inﬂuence the outcome in
Syria, but to this point GCHQ has not offered much beyond messaging and limited online
effects operations. GCHQ’s ability to contribute signiﬁcantly to the overall Syria SIGINT
effort is hampered by GCHQ’s limited resources. It should be noted that the UK
Intelligence Community is just as concerned about the end state of Syria’s chemical and
biological weapons as the US. Intelligence Community. Sir Iain may want to discuss
Syria’s use of chemical weapons and how the US. Government intends to react. For
more information about NSA ’s posture against Syria, see attached Near East Division-
produced paper on Syria.

0 (TS//SI//OC/REL TO USA, FVEY) Director Talking Points: Syria remains
locked in a protracted struggle, with both the opposition and the regime ﬁrmly
entrenched in their positions. Attempts to coalesce the opposition have moved
extremely slowly, while the regime has not in any way indicated that it would
willingly stand aside. Given this lack of movement in negotiations and the
stalemate on the ground, we anticipate the conﬂict will not be resolved in an
expedient manner.

0 (TS//SI//OC/REL TO USA, FVEY) NSA continues to monitor the situation in
Syria from all angles, including from the viewpoint of the regional, international,
and radical actors. NSA remains concerned about chemical weapons security and
continues to monitor the situation closely, to the best of our ability.

— (TS//SI//NF) Iran: GCHQ and the UK Government remain concerned about events in
Iran and the possibility that tensions with the West or Israel could escalate. The visitor
may ask NSA and SID leadership to share their views on what is going to happen with
