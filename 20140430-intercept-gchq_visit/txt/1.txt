VISIT PRECIS

Sir Iain Lobban, KCMG, CB
Director, Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ)
30 April 2013 - 1 May 2013

 

BACKGROUND: (U//FOUO) As General Alexander’s UK counterpart, Sir Iain has visited
NSA on several occasions as one would expect, both in his current position and previous ones.
Sir Iain most recently visited NSA on 27 March 2012, when he accompanied Air Chief Marshal
Sir Stuart Peach. That visit had a more deﬁned purpose of introducing Sir Stuart to
USCYBERCOM and NSA leadership as the Commander of the UK’s newly-established Joint
Forces Command. This will be the first visit in some time that will allow the visitor to reconnect
with NSA Leadership on NSA/GCHQ matters.

PURPOSE OF THE VISIT: (U//FOUO) As the Director of GCHQ, Sir Iain wants to reconnect
with NSA Leadership on matters of mutual concern, and to ensure each partner is aware of the
other’s activities and future plans.

CDR/DCDR/DDIR GUIDANCE: (U) N/A

PREP SESSION GUIDANCE: (U//FOUO) NONE
NSA/CSS REQUESTED: (U//FOUO) NONE
CYBERCOM REQUESTED: (U//FOUO) NONE

KEY TOPIC AREAS:

(TS//SI//NF) FAD and SUSLOL are not aware of any particular issues that Sir Iain will want to
address. NSA leadership should still be aware of the following topics that may pertain to their
organizations or areas of responsibility, as the potential exists for them to be brought up by the
visitor:

— (TS//SI//NF) FAA 702 Data: Unsupervised access to FAA 702 data, in a manner similar
to Olympics Option, remains on GCHQ’s wish list and is something its leadership still
desires. NSA and SID leadership are well aware of GCHQ’s request for this data, and the
steps necessary for approval. NSA leadership could be asked whether we’re still
supportive of this initiative. On a related topic, progress continues on “Triage 2.0,”
GCHQ access to FAA 702 data under supervised conditions. The MOA is now back in
