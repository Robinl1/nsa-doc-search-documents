Games: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Inﬂuence Activities

 

 

f. Conditioning: The player’s actions result in an outcome, which can be the
desired outcome, a different yet positive outcome, or a negative outcome.

Reﬂection: In the wake of the outcome, a player consciously or subconsciously
makes an assessment about what worked, what didn’t work, what could be
improved, and how to take action differently in the future.

Unlearning to Openness: Reﬂection enables the “unlearning” of decisions and
actions taken in the previous game and creates openness to trying again to
succeed. This completes one learning cycle and starts another.

 

The structure of games promotes learning through a rewards system.

Video and other games teach a “correct” course of action by providing immediate
feedback on a player’s initial action. As discussed with regard to the learning
cycle, players then reﬂect on their initial action in an effort to achieve a better
outcome the next time they are faced with a similar situation in the game.

Learning = Action + Feedback + Reﬂection

 

Players advance to higher levels in games by learning appropriate responses
during earlier stages of the game. Games have reinforcement and punishment
mechanisms such. as gaining or losing points for desired responses (i.e. operant
conditioning).XXXVI

The chainsaw model of Video games visually represents the accumulation of
knowledge and/or skills that leads to advancement to a higher level in a game.
Players move through a series of micro-challenges that, when combined, lead to
advancement.
