Exhibit 4-1.‘ Comparison of Broadband and Online Gaming
Growth Rates in US, Asia and EMEA markets.

The advent of high speed internet access fundamentally transformed gaming into a
truly networked experience making gaming an online social experience.

° Broadband connectivity makes the stereotype of the lonely gamer spending long
hours in social isolation no longer tenable. What once was a relatively stand alone
application on the early personal computers and console gaming platforms is now
becoming increasingly social with the growth of Local Area Network (LAN)
games and the expansion of Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOG).
Gaming is now a social experience with users interacting with others in the game
(i.e. teams, clans, and guilds), online in other cyber mediums (i.e. web sites,
message boards and social networking sites), and in cybercafés.

0 Evidence is emerging of a budding online gaming culture in Central, Southeast,
and Southwest Asia powered by broadband Internet access. Many older but
enduring titles are being played by gamers at numerous Internet cafes.
Counterstrike is played extensively throughout the region with gamers
participating from Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, United Arab
Emirates, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Iran, Malaysia and Indonesia.****
Also, Kuma Games indicated that 20% of its total audience originated in the
Middle East region with significant amounts of game traffic coming from Egypt

 

“H Counter-Strike is considered the most popular online first-person shooter (FPS) game in the world with
the more than 200,000 players playing simultaneously and contributing more than 5.5 billion minutes of
playing time each month on the official network consisting of more than 100,000 servers. Counter-Strike is
played extensively throughout Central, Southeast, and Southwest Asia in addition to the core U.S.,
European and Asian markets.
