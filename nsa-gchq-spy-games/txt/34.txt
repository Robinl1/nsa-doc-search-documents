Virtual World Scenario

This scenario is ﬁctitious. A sophisticated terrorist network joins Second Life. On a
password—protected island of the virtual community, they construct replicas of sites that
they are interested in attacking, and carry out realistic, virtual dry runs of their attacks.

' They consider expanding their network and developing an on—going virtual
terrorist training camp, complete with lessons on the manufacture of bombs, the
proper use of artillery, and basic lessons on the most effective places to shoot a
person to mortally wound them.

Because virtual worlds can serve as a platform for hard—to—trace communications and
private, sometimes password—protected meetings when members are separated by
distance, the terrorist network also utilizes the virtual space for cell management and
meetings.

' The meetings help ensure that members are accounted for on a regular basis while
drawing little attention to the gathering or the members’ association.

' Virtual interaction helps team members become familiar and develop trust with
their teammates long before they meet face—to—face.

' Working together in games or virtual worlds build teams cohesion which
translates into better synergies in real—world situations.
