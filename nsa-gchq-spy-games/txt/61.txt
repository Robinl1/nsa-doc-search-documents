Exhibit 4-7: GPU versus CPU PerformanceCViji

Advanced rendering algorithms and techniques enable game designers to create
realistic 3D images within the game environment without sacrificing GPU
performance and allow gamers to experience the details of the environment. One
such method, parallax occlusion mapping, enables graphic game designers to
simulate the illusion of depth on uneven surfaces without increasing the geometric
complexity of rendered objects.TTTTTT Such innovation will allow games to create
3D virtual environments mimicking real world environmentsim 1:

Advances in the Science ofHaptics

Advances in haptics (the study of touch and the cutaneous senses) are expected to
grow in the coming years providing sensory feedback and furthering the level of
immersion in games.

Haptic devices allow users to experience a sensation of touch and physical
properties when they interact with virtual materials. They exert force in response
to a user's action, at the point of action. They enable active 'two-way' interaction
with virtual objects, where action and perception are brought together.Clx Haptic
devices have been making inroads in gaming for sometime, but recent and future

unconscious immersion in virtual worlds. For more information, see Synthetic Worlds, p87.
