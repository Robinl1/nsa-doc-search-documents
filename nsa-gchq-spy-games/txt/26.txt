Games: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Inﬂuence Activities

Video game play is rich in sensory experiences, engaging motor skills and
promoting visual experiences like artistic characters and a compelling
environment and auditory experiences like music.

Advancements in graphics have made characters and settings look more “real”,
strengthening the emotions they induce.

The rewards system of games that ultimately results in a reward or punishment for
the player, also can elicit formidable emotions. Rewards and punishments are
central to "stimulus-reinforcement" learning and “stimulus-response” learning.1

Games that elicit strong emotions can predispose a player toward a particular

viewpoint or cause, or provoke specific reactions on the part of the player.

For example, the game, Dafur Is Dying, evokes sympathy for the people of
Darfur. Players assume the role of a refugee from Dafur facing overwhelming
challenges and dangers. If the player is captured in the game by militiamen, a
caption on the screen reads: “You will likely become one of the hundreds of
thousands of people already lost to this humanitarian crisis,” and includes a
warning about the possibility of rape.11

The white supremacy propaganda game Ethnic Cleansing mentioned above
includes blaring racist hate music to help the game’s message resonate on an
emotional level with players.111

Foreign Ground, a first-person training game, has been developed for the
Swedish military to simulate peacekeeping operations. Graphic images of local
conditions provoke an emotional response and develop peacekeepers’ sense of
duty (see Figure 3).
