Games: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Inﬂuence Activities

Active Learning

Games can serve as a place to learn, imparting knowledge and teaching skills. The
structure of games promotes learning through a rewards system.

° Often, games require action without expertise, forcing players to experiment and
learn.

° Games also can reinforce previous learning experiences by allowing players to
interact with issues, ideologies, products and events in active and passive ways.

Knowledge and Skills

Games can serve as a place to learn, imparting knowledge and teaching skills.

0 During prehistoric times, hunting games were used to teach young people how to
handle dangerous situations in the wild.

° Today, games are often more complex, involving dynamic platforms,
sophisticated storylines, and diverse goals.

° Individuals progress through an entire learning cycle when playing a game,
beginning with openness to new situations and rules, then taking certain actions
and reﬂecting on them, and ﬁnally “learning” how to operate successfully in the
game (see Figure 1).

° Often the learning process continues outside the game in such ways as
conversations with friends, participation on fan websites, reading about the
games, and player meet-ups online.xxxm
