Games: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Inﬂuence Activities

Chapter Introduction

Games can serve sophisticated purposes beyond entertainment, providing terrorist
organizations with a powerful medium analogous to the internet to support its
operational objectives. Games have already been exploited by terrorist extremists and
sympathizers. Emerging trends within the game space suggest greater opportunities will
exist for future exploitation enhancing a range of terrorist operations, from supporting
strategic propaganda and inﬂuence activities, to more highly instrumental uses such as
communication, fundraising and recruitment.11x Such activities warrant concern given the
increasing popularity of gaming which seems to be transcending age, gender and cultural
boundaries.

 

Several plausible scenarios exist where terrorist organizations could leverage the
power of the gaming medium to achieve operational goals with minimal training and
expertise. This paper will outline the current capabilities and potential scenarios by game
genre demonstrating how a terrorist organization might exploit the game space. The
extent to which games can be used by terrorist groups to supplement their other activities
depends on a variety of factors, to include:

0 Internet connectivity of game users

' Cost and availability of hardware and/or software required to play game

' Level and kind of interaction between players that the game allows

0 Ease of use of game

' Degree of game skills transferability to real-world activity

0 Degree of realism in game design (such as graphics and programming sophistication)
' Barriers to game production
