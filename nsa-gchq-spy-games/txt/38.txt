Exhibit 3-6: Screen Shots for Searching for a Cache
To participate in geocaching, one
needs a place to post geocache locations (typically, the Internet), a hand-held GPS
component, and a “treasure.” Typically, geocachers sign up for an account on a
geocaching site. Once on the site, they can search for geocaches that others have left.

° Similarly, they can hide a cache and post its coordinates for other people to find.
° Geocaching’s popularity has spread across Europe and the United States.

0 Asia and Africa also are home to many participants.

The caches are ranked in terms of difficulty to find, the terrain, and the type of cache.

Once a cache is found, the geocacher typically will sign a log book at the site or via the
website to inform people that it has been found.
