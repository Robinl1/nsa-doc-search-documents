Games: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Inﬂuence Activities

FORWARD

Video games are a media platform that has become part of daily activity for many
around the world. Whether it is casual gaming on a cell phone or PC, or a virtual world
where individuals are connected via the Internet, interaction in and around games is
increasing. Games entertain, encourage interaction, enable financial gain, and teach
lessons. While many of these activities are meant to be harmless, they also have the
potential to be exploited for malicious activities.

Over the course of a year, extensive study was done on the common use of games and
their applicability to terrorist activities. Academic journals and papers, newspaper and
magazine articles, textbooks, non-fiction works, in-game exploration and personal
interviews on games, psychology and sociology, as well as attendance at seminars on
these issues (for example the Serious Games conference or SAIC’s Cyber-Inﬂuence
Conference series) represent the main sources for this report.

The report was written in five stand-alone papers that are compiled here as a
comprehensive primer for the current and potential future of game usage. A majority of
the information contained in this report identifies facts and trends and applies them to the
realm of IC concern (Chapters 1, 2, and 4). In addition, the paper contains examples of
fictitious scenarios that terrorists or extremists might employ (Chapter 3), technology
advancements and trends that might enable those scenarios (Chapter 4), and recommend
steps to ensure that those hypotheses are not realized (Chapter 5).
