Games: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Inﬂuence Activities

Emerging Trends

The following trends are expected to significantly extend the gaming space in
mature and nascent markets, creating a powerful medium analogous to the internet for
terrorist organizations to reach and target core audiences.

° While forthcoming trends in the gaming space have been separated into various
sections for analysis, there is considerable overlap between them in that one trend
often enables the other or is dependent on the other to come to fruition.

Broadband Diﬁ‘usion

The spread of broadband internet access will be a major enabler for online gaming
and its expansion into previously untapped markets.

° One of the most reliable historical indicators for the growth of online gaming is
high speed Internet access.lxx Broadband growth rates in the United States and
Asia have paralleled similar growth rates in online gaming, making the experience
in mature gaming markets informative of what can be expected in growing
markets.

0 European, Middle Eastern, and African (EMEA) markets are expected to see the
biggest growth inlonline gaming with the increased penetration of high speed
Internet access.1m Market analysts expect the number of online game participants
in the EMEA market to more than quadruple from 4 million in 2005 to 18 million
in 2010 growing at a compound rate of 35.1%.lxxu The projection of broadband
access is a major reason industry analysts see the EMEA as the fastest growing
market in the gaming industry increasing by a compound annual rate of 13 %
surpassing US$7.6 billion in 2005 and reaching US$139 billion by 2010.lxxul

° EMEA markets will mirror the expansion of broadband Internet access and online
gaming in more mature markets, however, its adoption will have some marked
differences. Industry analysts expect the growth of high speed Internet to initially
be more limited to Internet Cafes in the Middle East and Africa as opposed to
individual households due to the expense associated with deploying fixed-line or
‘wired’ infrastructures. Consequently, industry analysts expect broadband
wireless solutions to play a larger role in driving gaming in these markets,
particularly with the launch of Third Generation (3G) wireless services.
