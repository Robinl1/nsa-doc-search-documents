Games: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Inﬂuence Activities

Focus Areas

This section identifies and discusses three areas for focusing counterterrorism

efforts in the game space: in-game counterpropaganda, new game development, and
intelligence collection.

These three areas are most effectively pursued concurrently and holistically,
with operations in one area supporting operations in the other two, and with all
operations feeding into analysis of the counterterrorist threat in the game
space, as illustrated below.
