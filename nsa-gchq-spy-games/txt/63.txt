Games: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Inï¬‚uence Activities

Chapter Addendum

Emerging trends in the gaming space will be used to the advantage of groups
committed to terrorizing societies to achieve their goals. They will be an enabler of a
more mature and expanded gaming space, creating a powerful medium analogous to
the internet for terrorist organizations to reach and target core audiences.

Emerging trends will drive growth in the gaming space across age, gender and
cultural boundaries. Spread of existing technologies like broadband Internet
access and the advent of new technologies like next generation wireless networks
and mobile devices will mean greater access to individuals residing in burgeoning
markets.

Changes within the gaming space will continue at a rapid pace. While marked
differences will exist particularly with access methods, newer markets are
expected to mirror the experience of more mature markets in terms of growth and
usage patterns. Gaming will become a powerful medium playing an increasingly
important role in a range of ordinary human affairs, particularly in virtual worlds,
providing an extension and a Virtual component to supplement their operations.
