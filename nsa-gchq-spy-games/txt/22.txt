1. Openness: When an individual plays a game, he is open to its structures, rules and
messages.

2. Action: By nature, games present a problem that a player must address and act on in
order to advance in the game. Actions must take place Within the rules and value
systems of the game (in this diagram, the game is represented by the box
“Environment”) in order for the player to participate and move forward in the game.

a. Manifestation: The player’s desired outcome in the game is to succeed and
mitigate losses.

b. Inﬂuencing the external environment: The player takes action to try to
inﬂuence the course of the game.

c. Coaching: The rules of the game provide guidelines on how to take action and
what is permissible and acceptable.

d. Instinctive learning: When quick action is required, instincts will play a role in
how play is performed. This often includes a mix of: lessons learned from past
experiences, a player’s personal values system, and physical and emotional
reactions. This part of learning is generally subconscious.

e. Nurturing the individual: Assessments about how well the player is playing
the game are made frequently throughout the game.
