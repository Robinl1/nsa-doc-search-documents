Games: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Inﬂuence Activities

Chapter Introduction

Games are an effective inﬂuence platform because they promote both “active” and

“passive” learning, and are highly attractive pursuits for specific target audiences.

Games, by nature, are learning experiences. Playing a game involves building skills

in order to advance to new levels in the game.

0 Learning is central to a player’s in-game success.

Learning in games can be transparent (e. g. helping to refine a player’s shooting

technique) or hidden (developing a predisposition in a player toward a particular cause or

message).

0 The latter often involves the promotion within the game of a particular set of

values or ideologies via the storyline or setting, and the use of emotional “tools”

to elicit particular reactions.

Finally, games can be effective inﬂuence platforms because they are popular,
captivating players and encouraging them to return for more.

 

 

Video games are “weaponized” texts, or disrupters of psychic stability. . .I mean to say

that games perform what Pierre Bourdieu calls “symbolic violence”—in other words, that

“gentle, invisible form of violence, which is never recognized as such”. .. Like

educational institutions, video games are instances of symbolic violence in the sense that
they inﬂict themselves on players. The world of the video game is nothing more than the
on—screen rendering of programmed instructions and decrees. Players are “schooled” by
an aggressive bombardment of pixellated images and sounds. Every moment is a direct

imperative, an attack that demands a response.
