Geocaching Scenario
This scenario is ﬁctitious. A terrorist cell leader has cell members build and transport a

bomb to a detonation spot —a naval watch station between Los Angeles and San Diego —
using geocaching.

1. Cell member #1 buys a component of the bomb near Reno, Nevada. He then
stashes his purchase for the next member to find in south—central Nevada.

2. Cell member #2 knows only the code name of cell member #1. He knows that #1
will be hiding a partially built bomb that requires the component that he has
bought. He watches and waits for a posting by #l of a location within the
predetermined 100 miles from his base. When #1 posts, he rushes out to find the
cache, takes the developing bomb, adds his component, and takes it to a place
within 100 miles of the south—eastern Utah—Nevada border.

3. Cell member #3 repeats the same process as cell member #2. This process
continues until the bomb is completed.

4. The final cell member takes the bomb to the naval watch station and detonates it
as planned. No red ﬂags were raised because the transport and purchase of the
bomb components were spread out across four states.
