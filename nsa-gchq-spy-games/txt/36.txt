Mixed or Alternate Reality Games

Mixed and alternate reality games involve the use of mobile technology, GPS and
online communication in a real world environment. Because these games exist in both
cyberspace and the real world, the boundaries between virtual and real worlds are
blurred.

Alternate Reality Gaming

Alternate Reality Gaming (ARG), sometimes also called Immersive Gaming or
Interactive Fiction, is an emerging genre of online gaming and one of the first true art and
entertainment forms developed from and exclusively for the Internet. ARGs are played in
real-life spaces under fictitious auspices, usually using a cell phone, camera and/or
handheld GPS device, and the Internet.

° The Internet serves as a “base” for information on the game, calculating
individual or team points, and managing the game.

0 Technically, ARGs are a kind of MMORPG because of the important role of the
Internet in the games.

Other than entertainment, ARGs can be produced for education and training,
grassroots activism, and promotional campaigning.lxv

0 Titles of popular ARGs include Orbital Colony, Perplex City, Studio Cyphers,
Who is Benjamin Stove, The LOST Experience, and Ocular Eﬁect.
