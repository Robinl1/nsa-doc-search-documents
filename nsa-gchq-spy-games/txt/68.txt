Games: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Inﬂuence Activities

Collecting In-Game Intelligence

Gaming is an increasingly popular activity among many demographic groups
across North America, Europe, the Middle East and parts of Africa.CXIV Monitoring of in-
game activities and related game-devoted areas of the Internet such as blogs,
chatrooms, and virtual periodicals, provide signiﬁcant intelligence collection
opportunities.

For example, game space provides potential opportunities to identify terrorist
financial operations by monitoring the ﬂow of money in virtual economies and
determining who is involved in the buying and selling of virtual goods and fundraising.

° From Virtual real estate to virtual clothing for avatars, the sale of virtual goods is
increasing rapidly. Virtual monies hold real-world value and can be cashed-out
into hard currency. Game players trade Virtual products in exchange for real
money via portals such as E-bay and Second Life. Intangible goods in digital
worlds are estimated to be worth $1 billion to $2 billion.CXVI

0 Furthermore, players sharing account information may be utilizing game space to
transfer funds from one person to another — under the auspices of a single player’s
account. The ability to upload in-world currency makes this plausible. Studying
the activities and proﬁles of users selling Virtual goods might help determine
whether or not funds are being funneled by or to terrorists.

° “Gold farming,” or game-supported sweatshops in which workers play games to
develop the strongest avatars which can then be sold on websites such as E-bay
for large proﬁts, could be used for terrorist fundraising purposes. Where gold
farming is taking place and who is benefiting from the sale of avatars or goods
also represents a useful area of investigation.
