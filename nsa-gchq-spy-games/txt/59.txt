Korean Peninsula, as well as hundreds of vehicles (air and ground combat, as well

0 An emerging trend within content generation is using 3D Video game graphics
technology to create animated films known as Machinima. Combining aspects of
film making, animation and game design, Machinima allows users to create their
own film complete with sets, props, special effects, plots and virtual actors at a
minimal cost. Software products also allow users to capture game Video to
produce and edit in game events. One of the more popular political Machinima
pieces is French Democracy, a depiction of the 2005 French riots from the
Muslim perspective.

° High costs associated with developing games ($20-30 million per major title)
have led many smaller publishers on a path to leverage user generated content,
harnessing the users’ creativity as a resource to ‘populate’ the Virtual space.
Opening scripting options allows users to script events ranging from object
control, to avatar behavior, to mini-games and other complex programs making
imagination the only limitation of what a resident can create in the Virtual space.
This provides a unique opportunity for organizations to promote given agendas.
