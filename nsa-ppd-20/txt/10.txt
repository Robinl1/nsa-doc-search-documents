manner not reasonably likely to result in significant
consequences and use the minimum action required to mitigate
the activity. (S/NF)

such approval would otherwise be required) and the department or
agency head determines that:
An emergency action is necessary in accordance with the
United States inherent right of self—defense as recognized in
international law to prevent imminent loss of life or
significant damage with enduring national impact on the
Primary Mission Essential Functions of the United States
Government,5 U.S. critical infrastructure and key resources,

approved activities would not be more appropriate;

 

The Emergency Cyber Actions are reasonably likely not to
result in significant consequences;

intended to be nonlethal in purpose, action, and consequence;

The Emergency Cyber Actions will be limited in magnitude,
scope, and duration to that level of activity necessary to
mitigate the threat or attack;
