(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Support CNCI by ensuring that data stores are produced, common collection
system analytic techniques are developed, adequate infrastructure is built for increased processing, and
enhanced collection tasks in support of cyber defense are implemented to meet the operational needs
and satisfy agreements for collection and processing at selected Foreign Partner collection sites using
TURMOIL collection systems.

(U) There are no new activities in this Project for FY 2013.

(U) OCO resources in this project are used to:

(TS//SI//NF) Provide contracted services and equipment for upgrades on a processing suite at a
RAMPART—A site. The upgrade will exploit the latest technologies present in —
networks and consists of the design, procurement, integration, testing and deployment of advanced
processing capabilities hosted on the latest server technologies.

(U) The CCP expects this Project to accomplish the following in FY 2013:

(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Expand collection and processing capabilities resulting from joint
collaboration efforts and shared access initiatives to leverage the highly lucrative NSA/CSS Second Party
access and to exploit high speed Digital Network Intelligence.

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY ) Complete the deployment of NCC Increment 2 and 3 defensive software
applications in support of the CNCI interconnected network of sensors.

(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Support and expand the TURMOIL-based foreign site processing systems
in order to exploit high-speed Digital Network Intelligence. Support the continuing requirements of
infrastructure and communications improvements to RAMPART—A and WINDSTOP that will provide
exploitation of high speed Digital Network Intelligence.

(TS// SI//N F) Integrate Third Party releasable Dialed Number Recognition and Digital Network Intelligence
collection systems upgrades, developed by NSA/CSS, within the RAMPART-A site architecture. The new
capabilities will enable increased collection of communications available at each RAMPART—A site.

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Upgrade collection capabilities at each site to increase intelligence
production.

(TS// SI//N F) Develop additional access to communications links at each RAMPART—A site. This additional
access will increase the amount of international network coverage available for intelligence exploitation.

(TS//SI//NF) Develop one new Foreign Partner relationship that will enable NSA/CSS to access
international communications of high interest for intelligence exploitation.

(TS//SI//NF) Deploy, operate, or refresh systems to implement key CNCI goals against increasingly
complex communication signals at five RAMPART—A sites and two WINDSTOP sites.

(U) Changes From FY 2012 to FY 2013:
(SI/NF) WINDSTOP: -$17 .8 million (-$17.8 Base). The aggregate decrease is the result of:

62

(U) Increases:

— (S//SI//NF) $1.0 million to sustain the current level of operations and accesses with its Second-Party
partners.

— (S//SI//NF) $0.9 million for increased sustainment cost of current operations and Second-Party
relationships.
