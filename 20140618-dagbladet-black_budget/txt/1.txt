(U) Project Description

(U//FOUO) The Foreign Partner Access Project contains two major programs - RAMPART-A and
WINDSTOP.

(TS//SI//N F) The RAMPART-A program provides collection against long-haul international leased
communications through special access initiatives with world-wide SIGINT partnerships. RAMPART—A
employs TURMOIL capabilities, provided by the Net-Centric Capabilities (NCC) Project in the Mission
Processing & Exploitation Expenditure Center. Additional NCC efforts will address the processing challenges
of the volume, velocity, and variety of data present at the RAMPART-A sites. RAMPART—A has access to over
3 Terabits per second of data streaming world-wide and encompasses all communication technologies such as
voice, fax, telex, modem, e-mail internet chat, Virtual Private Network (VPN), Voice over IP (VoIP), and voice
call records.

(TS//SI//N F) The WINDSTOP program focuses on second party relationships. WINDSTOP currently partners
with all the second parties, but primarily the United Kingdom (UK), to develop a well-integrated, over-arching
architecture to utilize unprecedented access to communications into and out of Europe and the Middle East.
Collection capabilities include Digital Network Intelligence processing and selection capabilities for e—mail, web,
Internet chat, and VoIP.

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) This Project supports the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity
Initiative (CNCI) by enhancing capabilities that identify emerging threats and vulnerabilities to US
communication systems. This Project contains the RAMPART-A Modernization, RAMPART—A Operations and
WINDSTOP Sub-Projects.

(U) Base resources in this project are used to:

- (TS//SI//N F) Provide annual upgrades to system capabilities at existing Foreign Partner collection sites to
keep pace with the rapidly changing telecommunications field.

- (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Provide access and collection against international high-priority target

- (S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Support continuing requirements of infrastructure and communications
improvements within the Foreign Partner collection sites to collect high speed Digital Network Intelligence,
voice, fax, telex, e-mail, internet chat, VPN, and VoIP communications.
