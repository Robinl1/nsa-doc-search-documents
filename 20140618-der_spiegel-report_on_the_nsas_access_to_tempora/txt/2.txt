[TSHSIHREL] What happens when one site contains more data than all other
ms combined? At more than Ill times larger than the next biggest
KKEYSGDREJâ€œ TEMPDRA at GCHD is the world's largest KKEYSGDRE and the
NSA workforce is now getting greater access to it. This massive site uses over IIIIIIII]
machines to process and make available to analysts more than All billion pieces of
content a day. And starting today skilled NSA KKEYSGDRE users can get access to
the TEMPDRA database via the KKS-Gentral interface.

[TSHSIHREL] What is TEMPORA? TEMPDRA 1s GCIIQ's KKEYSCDRE "Internet
buffer'" which exploits the most valuable Internet links available to GGIIQ.
TEMPDRA provides a powerful discovery capability against Middle East; North
African and European target sets [among others}. Analysts who have benefited
from GGIIQ- Special Source accesses like INGENSER. or MUSGULAR will almost
certainly benefit from TEMPORA.

[TSHSIHREL] How valuable is TEMPORA? The value and utility ofTEMPDRA
were proven early into a 5-month evaluation that began this past March. With a
limited user base ofSIIIIII' analysts; TEMPDRA became the second most valuable
KKEYSGDRE access for discovery. Additionally; this small group of analysts
produced over 200' end-product reports and provided critical support to SIGIN'E
defensive; and cyber mission elements.

[TSHSIHREL] Why TEMPORA? TEMPDRA provides the ability to do content-based
discovery and development across a large array ofhigh-priority signals. Similar to
other KKEYSCDRE deployments; TEMPDRA effectively "slows down" a large chunk
ofInternet data; providing analysts with three working days to use the surgical
toolkit of the GENESIS language to discover data that otherwise would have been
missed. This tradecrait of content-based discovery using the GENESIS language
is a critical tool in the analyst's discovery tool kit; and nicely complements the
existing and well-known tradecrafts ofstrong selection targeting and bulk
meta-data analysis.

[TSHSIHREL] How do I get an account? To comply with GGHQ policy and to
ensure users are successful in such a large-scale environment; TEMPDRA access
reguires users to be proficient with KKEYSGDRE. At NSA this is achieved via the
completion ofvarious KKS Skilz achievements. Beginning today users will see a
new "TEMPORA'" achievement; which reguires users to have remained current with
their UK Legalities training [DVSG ITUUL be a level 3 or higher KKS Skilz usen and
have used GENESIS by either guerying or authoring fingerprints. Users who meet
those criteria will automatically be given TEMPDRA access in their KKS Central
account.

[SHSIHREL] What do I need to know about using TEMPORA? Although
TEMPDRA will appear as an additional database in KKS Central; there are some
important items analysts need to be aware ofwhen they search this database.
Analysts are asked to pay close attention to details concerning the UK Legality
reguirements on the TEMPDRA user-guidance wiki page. TEMPDRA gueries must
comply with both UK and US. legal reguirements; and the analytic community
must ensure we are using this access wisely and compliantly.
