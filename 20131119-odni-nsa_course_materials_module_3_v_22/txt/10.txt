'(TS77‘Sl77NF') (HMC Character): 80 now let‘s look at the type of evidence that can be used to justify RAS. NSA can use any information that is lawfully in our
possession. A published SIGINT report describing the results of electronic surveillance of a target might be more reliable than say pocket litter found during
a detainee’s interrogation -- but NSA can rely on any lawfully held evidence. The HMCs are responsible for assessing the quality and reliability of the
evidence.

(TSi‘l‘Sl-h‘N-F) (OGC Attorney): Sources that are often used to justify a RAS nomination include, but are not limited to:
- Existing FISA Orders

- SIGINT reports

- FISA surveillance data derived from other authorized targets

- SIGINT traffic, as long as the submitting analyst has performed a Reporting Source Validation Check
- SIGDEV work (with verified sources), and

- Other transcripts

then that information will only be visible to those —users with _)r— credentials, as confirmed
