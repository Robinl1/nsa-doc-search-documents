(U) No one else can make this determination!

 

ffSﬂSWNF; (OGC Attorney): The FISC states that the RAS decision is based on considerations of “reasonable and prudent persons.” This does not,
however, mean that anyone can approve an identiﬁer for RAS. There are a select number of people within NSA who have been given the authority to
approve identiﬁers for querying under these two authorities. Those individuals are called Homeland Mission Coordinators or HMCs.

(WP) (HMC Character): As wasjust mentioned, RAS determinations are typically made by specially trained personnel in the Ofﬁce of
Counterterrorism and its Extended Enterprise; these individuals are titled Homeland Mission Coordinators, typically abbreviated as HMCs. These
individuals, like me, have been given special training on how to apply the RAS standard and how to apply it consistently. HMCs are specially trained
individuals who have extensive experience working with this target set and who have extensive experience working with these authorities. The HMCs can
take a RAS nomination, review the facts, and make a determination as to whether or not that particular identiﬁer meets the RAS standard.

W (HMC Character): According to the BR and PR/TT Orders, in addition to the HMCS, the Chief and Deputy Chief of the Counterterrorism
Homeland Security Analysis Center are authorized to make a RAS determination; although, it is generally the Hlvle who make the RAS determinations. To
reemphasize, no one else is authorized to make RAS determinations according to the Orders.
