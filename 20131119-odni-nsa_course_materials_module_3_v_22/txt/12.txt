(TSﬁSl-h‘N-F) (HMC Character): Remember from earlier in this module, we introduced the RAS process as a simple equation: identifier + link to Foreign
Powers = RAS. Now you may be wondering how an identifier is nominated for RAS. NSA must demonstrate and document that when used to
query the bulk metadata meets the RAS standard PRIOR to querying the BR and PR/TT bulk metadata repositories. NSA created_ the RAS
identifier management tool, to streamline the adjudication of the RAS nomination statements and documentation of RAS determinations.

(TSl/S-l-ALN-F) (HMC Character): Typically, an intellioence a st will gatherthe necessary information and draft the nomination statement in IRONMAN
articulating the RAS equation. An HMC, also usin will review the nomination statement and approve or disapprove the request. lfthe
nomination statement is for a US. person, the ool includes functionality that allows the HMCs to forward such requests to OGC forthe required
First Amendment review. In either case, if the RAS nomination is approved, the identifier is now authorized for querying.

'(‘FSﬁSbS‘N-F) (OGC Attorney): Through —NSA documents all RAS-approved identifier:‘ Ithe rationale used to gain RAS approval.
IRONMAN provides the ability to ﬂy, review, approve/disapprove RAS nominations. is therefore the authoritative source forthe list

of RAS-approved identifiers, and ‘exports that list to other systems that require it.

 
  
  

 
   
   

(ISA‘SWNF) (OGC Attorney): It is important to rememberthat copies ofthe documents, such as court orders or reports, are required as part ofthe
nomination process. The papertrail should enable an auditor from Department ofJustice (DOJ) to clearly evaluate all of the evidence presented to support
a RAS decision.
