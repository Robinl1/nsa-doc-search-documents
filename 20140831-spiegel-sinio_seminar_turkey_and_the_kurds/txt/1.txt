{C} "Turkish Cross-Border Operations and Kurdish Intifada: Rhetoric or
Reality?"

Increasing threats and attacks by the terrorist group Kongra Gel (former
P100 in Turkish urban areas and tourist locations, mounting Turkish
pressure for action against Kongra Gel camps and leadership in northern
Iraq, and prolonged unrest in mostly Kurdish southeastern Turkey this
spring have the attention of senior US. policymakers. Chronic Turkish
government failure to address the underlying grievances of its Kurdish
population provides an environment that supports Kongra Gel's ability to
constitute a serious security threat for Turkey and pose a serious challenge
for US. policymakers as unilateral Turkish military action in northern Iraq is
a hotbutton (nightmare) issue for the United States. Is Turkish cross-border
action likely? Can Kongra Gel make good on its threats of wider attacks?
Who are the Kurdistan Freedom Hawks? Why did the social unrest and riots
in March occur? Will they persist? What role does Kongra Gel play? How
does the Intelligence Community assess these issues? What role does

SIG INT play?
