SID-Today - NCRs with Foreign Relations Missions Become 'SUSLAs'

[SHSU Recently, we created another title speciﬁcally for our representatives to
major Third Parties: ”Special US Liaison Advisor" (SUSLAs), who are the senior
representatives of the DIRNSAICHCSS to a speciﬁc Third Party. The ﬁrst SUSLA
named was Special US Liaison Adviser, Italy, and Special US Liaison Advisor,
Germany followed shortly thereafter,

[UHFDUm Until recently, a few of the NCRs have been performing SUSLA duties
but were still called NCRs. This led to some measure of confusion in a variety of
administrative matters, mostly within headquarters. By changing the titles of these
NCRs to SUSLAS we have eliminated this confusion and provided a more rational
approach to titles by re-designating those positions that are primarily foreign
affairs-related as SUSLAs,:=- reserving the title NCR to those senior representatives
with primarily Command and other US Government Agency representation.

(UHFOUD) Note that this change applies to the title only - not to mission, function,
authorities, duties, or reporting chain. There is also no change in relationships and
existing oversight authorities arranged between these positions, NSAICSS Europe
or NSNCSS Paciﬁc, and the Foreign Affairs Directorate.

[SHED The following NCRs' titles have changed:

NCR Turkey is new Special US Liaison Adviser Turkey (SUSLAT)

NCR Thai is new Special US Liaison Adviser, Thailand (SUSLAB)

NOR] is new Special US Liaison Adviser, Japan (SUSLAJ)

NCR KOR is already dual-titled as Special US Liaison Adviser, Korea; the use
of the NCR KOR title is being phased out (SUSLAK)

FYI, The Special US Liaison Adviser refers to the chief of the site, while Special US
Liaison Activity refers to the site itself. Either way, it's "SUSLA"!

(UHFOUO) Note that our Special US Liaison Ofﬁcers located in Second Party
nations are SUSLOS, and are all designated with the name of the partner's capital
city (e.g., SUSLOL = Special US Liaison Ofﬁcer, London). Those titles have not
been changed.
