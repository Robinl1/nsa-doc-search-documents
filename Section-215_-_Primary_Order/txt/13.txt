tradecraft to the results of intelligence analysis queries of the collected BR metadata.

alteration of these dissemination procedures, it may obtain prospectively—applicable
modifications to the procedures upon a determination by the Court that such modifications are
appropriate under the circumstances and in light of the size and nature of this bulk collection.
