~ (iv) Queries of the BR metadata using RAS—approved selection terms may
. occur either by manual analyst query or through the automated query process

described below.“ This automated query process queries the collected BR
metadata (in a ” collection store”) with RAS-approved selection terms and returns
the hop-limited results from those queries to a ”corporate store.” The corporate
store may then be searched by appropriately and adequately trained personnel
for valid foreign intelligence purposes, without the requirement that those
searches use only RAB-approved selection terms. The specifics of the automated

query process, as described in the- Declaration, are as follows:

 

 

‘1 This automated query process was initially approved by this Court in its_ 2012
Order amending docket number

12 As an added protection in case technical issues prevent the process from verifying that the
most up-to-date list of RAS—approved selection terms is being used, this. step of the automated
process checks the expiration dates of RAS—approved selection terms to conﬁrm that the
approvals for those terms have not expired. This step does not use expired RAB—approved
selection terms to create the list of ”authorized query terms” (described below) regardless of
whether the list of RAS—approved selection terms is up-to—date.
