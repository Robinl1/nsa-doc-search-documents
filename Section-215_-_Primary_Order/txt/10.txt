'9 TheCourt understands that from time to time the information available to designated
approving ofﬁcials will indicate that a selection term is or was associated with a Foreign Power
only for a specific and limited time frame. In such cases, a designated approving official may
determine that the reasonable, articulable suspicion standard is met, but the time frame for
which the selection term is or was associated with a Foreign Power shall be speciﬁed. The
automated query process described in the-Declaration limits the first hop query
results to the speciﬁed time frame. Analysts conducting manual queries using that selection

term shall continue to properly minimize information that may be returned within query results
that fall outside of that timeframc.
