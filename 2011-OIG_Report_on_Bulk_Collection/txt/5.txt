programs. These programs are authorized to collect in bulk certain dialing, routing,
addressing and signaling information about telephone calls and electronic
communications, such as the telephone numbers or e-mail addresses that were
communicating and the times and dates but not the content of the calls or e-mail
messages themselves;

majority of that information is never reviewed by any person, because the information is
not responsive to the limited queries that are authorized for intelligence purposes;

particularly for US. persons, and are monitored by the FISA Court and Congress;
