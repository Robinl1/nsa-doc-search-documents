photocopies may be made of the document, and any notes taken by Members may not be
removed from the secure location. We further understand that HPSCI staff will be present at all
times when the document is being reviewed, and that Executive Branch ofﬁcials will be
available nearby during certain, pre-established times to answer questions should they arise. We
also request your support in ensuring that the Members are well informed regarding the
importance of this classiﬁed and extremely sensitive information to prevent any unauthorized
disclosures resulting ﬁ-om this process. We intend to provide the same document to the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) under similar conditions, so that it may be made
available to the Members of the Senate, as well as cleared leadership, SSCI and Senate Judiciary
Committee staff.

(U) We look forward to continuing to work with you and your staff as Congress continues its
deliberations on reauthorizing the expiring provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act.

Sincerely,

WM

Ronald Weich
Assistant Attorney General
