photocopies may be made of the document, and any notes taken by Members may not be
removed from the secure location. We further understand that SSCI staff will be present at all
times when the document is being reviewed, and that Executive Branch oﬁicials will be
available nearby during certain, pre-established times to answer questions should they arise. We
also request your support in ensuring that the Members are well informed regarding the
importance of this classiﬁed and extremely sensitive information to prevent any unauthorized
disclosures resulting from this process. We intend to provide the same document to the House
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) under similar conditions, so that it may be
made available to the Members of the House, as well as cleared leadership, HPSCI and House
Judiciary Committee staﬁ‘.

(U) We look forward to continuing to work with you and your staff as Congress continues its
deliberations on reauthorizing the expiring provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act.

Sincerely,

WM

Ronald Weich
Assistant Attorney General
