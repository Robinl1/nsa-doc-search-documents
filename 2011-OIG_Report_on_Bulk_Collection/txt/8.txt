The
RAS requirement is designed to protect against the indiscriminate querying of the collected data
so that only information pertaining to one of the foreign powers listed in the relevant Court order

is provided to NSA personnel for further intelligence analysis. The bulk data
collected under each program can be retained for 5 years.

Congressional Oversight

(U) These programs have been briefed to the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees,
through hearings, brieﬁngs, and visits to NSA. In addition, the Intelligence and Judiciary
Committees have been fully briefed on the compliance issues discussed below.

Compliance Issues

-(-"FS#SI#NF—)—In 2009, a number of technical compliance problems and human
implementation errors in these two bulk collection programs were discovered as a result of
Department of Justice (DOJ) reviews and internal NSA oversight. However, neither DOJ, NSA,
nor the FISA Court has found any intentional or bad—faith violations. _

E||

accordance with the Court’s rules, upon discovery, these inconsistencies were reported as
compliance incidents to the FISA Court, which ordered appropriate remedial action. The FISA
Court placed several restrictions on aspects of the business records collection program until the

compliance processes were improved to its satisfaction. —

(U) The incidents, and the Court’s responses, were also reported to the Intelligence and
Judiciary Committees in great detail. The Committees, the Court and the Executive Branch have
responded actively to the incidents. The Court has imposed safeguards that, together with
greater efforts by the Executive Branch, have resulted in signiﬁcant and effective changes in the
compliance program.

(U) All parties will continue to report to the FISA Court and to Congress on compliance
issues as they arise, and to address them effectively.
