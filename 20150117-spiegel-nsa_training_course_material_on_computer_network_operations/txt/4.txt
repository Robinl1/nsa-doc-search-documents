 

WHY 'ARE WE TEACHING THIS?

 

 

- 5 Pillars of IO:
— OPSEC
— MILDEC
— M/so
— EW
— CNO

- The next major conflict will start in cyberspace
— Whether we recognize the signs is another matter

— Recent conflicts have already shown the importance of CNO (Russia/Georgia)

— Think China will make a move on Taiwan without bringing down their communications
networks?

° As IW officers (or IDC) — we are expected to know and understand
CNO and communicate with decision makers

° Recently announced plans from Command in Chief and Pentagon
officials emphasize cyber space operations

- Basic 1810/IDC quals are a good foundation, but CO/XO want you to
know more about CNO
