- Discuss the following as it pertains to ICMP:

— ICMP is a protocol that defines a collection of message types commonly used for network
diagnostics.

- Layer of the 08! model: ICMP (usually) consists of Layer 3 (Network) messages
transported by IP.

- Ping: Message Type 8 (request) and 0 (reply). Used to determine if a device is active
on the network.

- Traceroute: Uses a combination of the IP time-to-live (TTL) field and the ICMP
messages 11 (time exceeded) and 3.3 (port unreachable) to determine the route a

packet takes through the network.
