SIGINT activities, including
material dealing with SIGINT
enabling; cover plans,
programs, and mechanisms;
and/or clandestine SIGINT

of particular cover
mechanisms, are much the
same today as they were prior
to 1968. Revealing the
speciﬁc covert activities
would nullify the particular
programs where they are
successfully used today.
Targets would adopt blanket
denial practices not used
today because they simply do
not appreciate how
NSA/CSS’s covert activities
support SIGINT successes.

(U//FOUO) TICOM was a

NSA/CSS’s Second Party
partnerships are
extraordinarily close, and in
some cases it is impossible to
tell where one partner’s work
ends and another’s starts. In
many cases, for a variety of
reasons originating within the
respective partner’s
government, Second Party
partners insist that their
involvement in specific
projects or operations must
not be released. The
UKUSA agreement mandates
that the Second Parties
respect each others’
preferences in these cases.
