(U//FOUO) Declassiﬁcation
of FISINT-related material
that is 50 years old and older
would show NSA/CSS’s
ability to fully exploit the
data, even with the lack of an
identiﬁcation key and poor
signal quality, and likely lead
to widespread data denial
practices among target
countries who do not
currently appreciate how well
their signals are currently
being exploited by NSA.
This would deprive the U. S.
of vital knowledge of foreign
weapons and space systems,
which in turn would
ultimately lead to policy
decisions being made on
faulty/incomplete data and to
increased loss of life and
mission failure during future
military operation.

(U) Serious or exceptionally
grave damage to national
security can be expected if
this material were to be
declassified, depending on
the particular information
being revealed.

Declassifying information
