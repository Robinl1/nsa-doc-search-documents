of material

Listening Posts (LPs) are
physical locations that are
close to the target facility and
serve as a collection point for
the signals of interest.
Identification of a LP could
result in the identification of
information such as the
identities of cooperating
parties/people. Exposure of
such information could
adversely impact current and
future operations by revealing
information about partner
relationships.

(U) Exceptionally grave
damage to national security
can be expected if this

(S//SI//REL TO USA,
FVEY) The methods used to
exploit SDS signals and radio
ﬁngerprinting are basically
the same today as they have
been during the period of
interest. Specific details
regarding how NSA/CSS
exploits such signals, as well
as the physical locations
where it may access them,
would provide adversaries
information they need to deny
them to NSA/CSS. Targets of
interest could develop
countermeasures that would
render NSA/CSS’s current
capability to collect SDS
ineffective.

(U) Serious damage to
national security can be
expected if this material were
to be declassified.
