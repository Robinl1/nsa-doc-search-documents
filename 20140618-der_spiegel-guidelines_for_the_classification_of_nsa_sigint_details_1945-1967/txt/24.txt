(U) A document that
demonstrates or includes the
application of any
cryptanalytic technique to an
electromechanical cipher
system that is an alphabet
generator is
UNCLASSIFIED only if the
system is UNCLASSIFIED in
accordance with the WWII
Guidance.

(U) This guidance pertains to

documents relating to:

0 Wired wheels (such as
ENIGMA),

0 Telephone selectors
(such as PURPLE, RED,

Hagelin alphabet generators.

(C//REL TO USA, FVEY) In
this time frame, commercial
companies and nation states
developed and deployed
cryptographies which have
many features still in use in
cryptosystems NSA/CSS
exploits today. Documents
that detail the application of
cryptanalytic techniques to
these earlier systems will
reveal capabilities still in use
today against operational
target cipher systems.
