still used today. Revealing
this “who,” “when,” “where,”
and “how” could provide an
adversary with a great deal of
insight into NSA’s targets,
collection sites, and other
collection- and analysis-
related information that is
still being used today.

(U) Various levels of harm to
national security can be
expected if this material were
to be declassified, depending
on the particular information
being revealed.

(U) The fact of NSA/CSS
targeting, collecting, or
processing against any nation
not listed as classiﬁed
through 1967 is
UNCLASSIFIED.

(U) Revealing these speciﬁc
targets will enable
adversaries to deduce the
strength and range of
NSA/CSS’s capabilities at
that time. When there is
direct link between the
communications systems used
then and those used today,
the targets can adopt blanket
denial practices not currently
used because they simply do
not appreciate how well their
signals are currently being
exploited by NSA/CSS. In
addition, certain historical
targets are also (and were in
the timeframe covered by this
guide) SIGINT partners, and
revealing that NSA/CSS
targeted nations that are
current partners could have
an immediate negative effect
on those relationships.
