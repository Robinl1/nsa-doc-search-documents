TURMOIL/APEX/APEX High Level Description Document - WikiInfo

o Dataﬂow Phase 2: Migrate additional HAMMERSTEIN voice ﬂows to
PRESSUREWAVE. Exﬁl all signaling via port selection and let the normal
TURMOIL selection process select it.

o Dataﬂow Phase 3: Institutionalize APEX capability and continue to
migrate other voice ﬂows to PRESSUREWAVE.

[edit] Goals by Spin

[edit] (U) Spin 15 goals

(TS/lSI/lREL) The minimal goal for Spin 15 is to achieve VPN phase 1 — IKE
metadata extraction using C&C phase 1 — manual conﬁguration. The APEX
VPN goal is complete when a CES / TAO VPN analyst validates the SRI and the
IKE metadata content in TOYGRIPPE. See TURMOIL Spin 15

StomﬁReguirements ’

(TS/lSI/IREL) A highly desirable goal for Spin 15 is to achieve VoIP phase 1 —
HAMMERCHANT capture — with CSzC phase 1 — manual conﬁguration. The
APEX VoIP goal is complete when a VoIP analyst validates that RTP bundled by
TURMOIL is correctly processed by the VoIP analytic and stored in
CONVEYAN CE.

[edit] (U) Spin 16 goals

(TS/lSI/lREL) The minimal goals for Spin 16 are

0 to achieve VPN phases 2 and 3 — targeted IKE forwarding and static
tasking of ESP using C&C phase 2 — semi—automatic conﬁguration of
HAMMERMILL and TURMOIL APEX components.

a to achieve VoIP phase 1 — HAMMERCHANT targeted VoIP RTP exﬁl is
captured by TURMOIL.

o to achieve Dataﬂow phase 1 — Collected IKE is sent to CES database.
Collected targeted data is deposited into PRESSUREWAVE and analysts
can query and view the data.

[edit] (U) Spin 17 goals

(TS/lSI/IREL) The minimal goals for Spin 17 are

0 to achieve CSzC phase 3 and VPN phase 4 — ESP dynamic targeting
using TURBINE.

o to achieve VoIP phase 2 — HAMMERCHANT Survey

0 to achieve Dataﬂow Phase 2 — Migrate additional HAMMERSTEIN voice
ﬂows to PRESSUREWAVE.
