[edit] (U) IPSEC VPN/IKE/ESP Protocols

(TS/lSI/lREL) IPSec describes a suite of protocols for creation of VPN tunnels
between devices. ﬂ is the protocol used to exchange cryptographic
parameters and establish a secure tunnel. E_SP is the protocol that performs
the packet—by—packet encryption. A wide variety of algorithms of varying
strengths may be used within IPSEC. CES generally requires the packets from
both sides of an IKE exchange and knowledge of the associated pre—shared key
(PSK) in order to have a chance of recovering a key for the corresponding
cipher (ESP). A major goal of APEX is to access two sides of key exchanges for
trafﬁc of interest.

[edit] (U) HAMMERMILL/HAMMERCHANT/HAMMERSTEIN

(TS/lSI/IREL) HAMMERMILL is the base capability for implants on a family of
routers. Built on HAMMERMILL are a suite of mission applications for
collection of various types of trafﬁc. HAMMERMILL uses FASHIONCLEET to
exﬁl a copy of targeted data as a packet stream.

(TS/lSI/lREL) HAMMERMILL 2.0 is deployed and is commanded by a custom
command interface. Targeting information must be delivered via these
manually initiated commands to the HAMMERMILL application.
HAMMERMILL 2.5 is designed to accept command and control via
CHIMNEYPOOL messages and is awaiting testing.

(TS/lSI/IREL) HAMMERSTEIN is a HAMMERMILL application module that is
tasked to collect all packets that match a 5—tuple ﬁlter of source and
destination IP address, source and destination port, and protocol.
HAMMERSTEIN can collect IKE and ESP based on a 5—tuple ﬁlter.
HAMMERCHANT is an application module that identiﬁes VoIP (H.323/SIP)
signaling passing through the router, extracts the user identiﬁers, and collects
the call if one of the users corresponds to an entry on its target list.

[edit] (U) FASHIONCLEFT Protocol/CDR

(TS/lSI/lREL) FASHIONCLEFT is the protocol used by HAMMERMILL and
other TAO implants to deliver collected data back to the TAO Common Data
Receptor (CDR). FASHIONCLEFT precedes an exﬁl session with a strongly
encrypted Session Announcement that describes the parameters of the exﬁl
sessmn.

[edit] (S/lSI/IREL) TURMOIL Existing Capability - VPN
(TS/lSI/IREL) TURMOIL is a passive ﬁltering and collection device targeting
high—speed networks. Within TURMOIL are existing (passive) IPSEC

processing capabilities, processing IKE and ESP packets identiﬁed by the
TURMOIL front—end ﬁltering.
