metadata arrives in PRESSUREWAVE. This process extracts the ﬁle, converts
the records into a format that TOYGRIPPE ingests, and forwards the result to
TOYGRIPPE. To support APEX, all three of the components manipulating the
metadata — the TURMOIL metadata extractor, the VPN analytic and the
TOYGRIPPE database — require modiﬁcation to support the additional
information about the data source that APEX provides (see Analytic
Challenges from APEX ’ ).

[edit] (U) APEX

(TS/ISI/IREL) Currently HAMMERMILL exﬁls its packets by sending both the
EASHIONCLEET session announcement and the exﬁlled packet stream to one
of the Common Data Receptor addresses. APEX changes the operation of

HAMMERMILL eXﬁl.

[edit] (TS/lSI/IREL) HAMMERMILL exﬁl operation in APEX

 

o The destination address for HAMMERMILL exﬁl is set to direct the trafﬁc
to a link that a TURMOIL can see.

0 The TURMOIL APEX components are conﬁgured with the HAMMERMILL
destination address and any ports needed to identify potential
HAMMERMILL trafﬁc with a 5—tuple ﬁlter. The APEX components are also
provided with parameters needed to decrypt the EASHIONCLEET
protocol and reconstruct the exﬁlled packets to their original form.

0 The APEX code unwraps the EASHIONCLEET protocol, reconstructs the
packets and directs them to an application—speciﬁc process (currently
VoIP or VPN). This process is responsible for properly handling the
application metadata delivered in the Session Announcement (e.g.
to/from phone numbers for VoIP), the exﬁlled packets, and the
conﬁguration information in the TURMOIL conﬁguration ﬁle to mark and
direct datato the appropriate path for further processing.

[edit] (Sl/SI/IREL) Follow-on processing paths within TURMOIL

(TS/ISI/IREL) After APEX unwraps EASHIONCLEET, the reconstructed packets
can be directed to one of two follow—on processing paths within TURMOIL,
depending on the nature of the application: recirculation or forwarding.

(TS/lSI/IREL) The recirculation path presents the APEX—unwrapped packets
and metadata to the TURMOIL ﬁltering components as if they arrived on
TURMOIL’s passive input. The recirculated packets can then engage
TURMOIL’s passive processing and selection.

(TS/ISI/IREL) The forwarding path bundles the reconstructed packets together
with appropriate metadata and sends the bundle home through the normal
TURMOIL forwarding path to PRESSUREWAVE, where further analytic
processes may be run to prepare the data for corporate consumption.
