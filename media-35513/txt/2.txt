DC Radar Task 4, Modernizing VoIP and VPN
[edit] (U) Motivation

(TS/lSI/IREL) APEX describes the cross—organizational effort to achieve a
capability for shaping of TAO active collection from HAMMERMILL routers to
TURMOIL, a midpoint passive collector. The collection missions for this effort
are targeted VoIP collection (HAMMERCHANT) and collection of IPSec ﬂ
trafﬁc (HAMMERSTEIN). The desire to have the active—passive integration
capability is driven by three key motivations: scaling the exploitation of
streaming content, enhancing the likelihood of success for the VPN capability,
and eventually creating new capabilities that can't be achieved separately. In
speciﬁc:

 

o Routers exﬁltrate content in real—time as a packet stream rather than as a
ﬁle. Current TAO backend collectors for HAMMERMILL are expected to
be strained with a large number of streaming packet exﬁl sessions. The
current backend capacity to receive HAMMERMILL streams is expected
to limit the number of simultaneous VoIP 0r VPN streams that can be
received.

a The capability to decrypt selected IPSEC/ﬂ streams is built into
TURMOIL, as is the capability to route back to CES the IPSEC key
exchanges necessary to recover selected keys. Directing IPSEC VPN
trafﬁc to TURMOIL puts it where it can be most efﬁciently used.

0 Integration with TURMOIL and TURBINE will enable HAMMERMILL
missions to leverage TURMOIL selection and targeting rather than
operating stand—alone. This would make implants lighter, and less
complex, at the expense of possibly more exﬁlled trafﬁc.

(TS/lSI/IREL) The end—state goal of the APEX development is to

o Achieve the real—time exﬁl of HAMMERMILL active collection and direct
it to a TURMOIL passive collector that can recognize the trafﬁc, unwrap
the packets from the TAO protocol, and restore the packets to their
original state.

0 Perform appropriate processing/forwarding of the unwrapped content to
corporate repositories, and optionally perform further target
identiﬁcation and trafﬁc selection in TURMOIL

o Engage TURBULENCE storage and analytic processes for delivery of
content to analysts

0 Enable TURBINE dynamic control of both HAMMERMILL and TURMOIL,
allowing near—real—time implant tasking based on feedback from
TURMOIL.
