responsible for keeping the two in sync.

o C&C phase 2: semi—automatic conﬁguration for an already established
presence: TURBINE receives the parameters for a mission and in an
automated fashion conﬁgures both the HAMMERMILL implant and the
corresponding TURMOIL APEX components. The TURBINE—
HAMMERMILL interface will use CHIMNEYPOOL RPC commands, and
the TURBINE—TURMOIL interface will use ISLANDTRANSPORT
HAMMERMILL 2.5 is the HAMMERMILL version that can receive
CHIMNEYPOOL commands and is required for phase 2. HAMMERMILL
2.5 will be available only for low—end MIPS platforms.

- C&C phase 3: dynamic targeting for an already established presence:
TURBINE sets initial conﬁguration parameters as in Phase 2. Exﬁlled
trafﬁc is evaluated by TURMOIL components for potential additional
targeting information. TURMOIL messages to TURBINE to dynamically
target a particular ﬂow through the router. An example is receiving an
IKE key exchange (and possibly a few initial packets), evaluating the IP
addresses to decide if the VPN being set up corresponds to a target, and
messaging back to HAMMERMILL to capture and exﬁl the corresponding
ESP.

(TS/lSI/lREL) Phase 3 of control must be managed so that router exﬁl does not
exceed the tolerable bandwidth limits set by OPSEC and operational concerns.
TURBINE may need to implement additional workﬂows in support of Phase 3
to monitor and control exﬁl volume. These workﬂows will have to be designed
to ﬁt the metrics and monitoring information that HAMMERMILL and APEX
are capable of providing.

[m] (TS/lSI/IREL) VPN phases

(TS/lSI/IREL) The development of the VPN process via APEX will proceed in a
phased fashion.

0 VPN phase 1: IKE metadata only: IKE packets are exﬁled to TURMOIL
and unwrapped by APEX, recirculated and presented to the VPN
processing components. Metadata is extracted from each key exchange
for the CES TOYGRIPPE metadata database. This database is used by
SIGDEV analysts to identify potential targets for further exploitation.

o VPN phase 2: Targeted IKE forwarding: In addition to the metadata
generation, the IKE addresses are looked up in KEYCARD. If either IP
address is targeted, the key exchange packets are forwarded to the CES
Attack Orchestrator.

I VPN phase 3: Static (manual) tasking of ESP: HAMMERSTEIN may be
statically (manually) tasked to forward targeted ESP. The exﬁltrated ESP
