TURMOIL/APEX/APEX High Level Description Document - WikiInfo

(TS/lSI/lREL) The passive VPN metadata generation capability receives IKE
packets from TURMOIL’s front—end packet ﬁltering and creates a metadata
record for each key exchange seen, destined eventually for the TOYGRIPPE
database. This process can be deployed anywhere a TURMOIL is deployed.

(TS/lSI/lREL) The "PIQ blade" processes targeted IKE and ESP. This capability
cannot be deployed to all TURMOIL sites, only to those that meet CES security
constraints.

(TS/lSI/lREL) The PIQ blade performs two main tasks. It checks the IKE source
and destination addresses against a target list stored in KEYCARD. If one of
these is targeted, it sends the key exchange packets back in near—real—time to
CES databases via a connection directly to the CES Attack Orchestrator (A0).

(TS/lSI/IREL) The PIQ blade also receives ESP trafﬁc. When a new targeted
tunnel is observed, the PIQ blade asks the AO if a key is available and buffers
the ESP trafﬁc as long as it can while waiting for a key If a key is returned,
the ESP is decrypted and the underlying IP packets are made available for
other application processing in TURMOIL. Because ESP encrypts packet—
by—packet, the PIQ blade can begin decryption of a session when a key arrives,
even if the earliest packets have fallen out of the buffer.

[edit] (Sl/SI/IREL) TURMOIL Existing Capability - VoIP

(SI/SI/IREL) TURMOIL also contains existing capability for processing VoIP
trafﬁc, including ﬂ and H.323. Capabilities for other VoIP protocols are in
development. The passive capability relies on seeing the signaling setting up a
call, extracting identiﬁers related to the calling and called parties, looking up
these identities for targeting information (via a KEYCARD lookup), and
collecting targeted trafﬁc. TURMOIL also has the capability to generate
metadata records for all calls, not just targeted ones, for the FASCIA database.

[edit] (U) TURBINE

(TS/lSI/lREL) TURBINE is focused on command and control of covert implants.
It can execute automated workﬂows and is designed to communicate with
TURMOIL as well as other devices, enabling integration of active and passive
information in near—real—time. TURBINE communicates with covert implants
via CHIMNEYPOOL messages over a covert infrastructure, and with TURMOIL
and other devices via ISLANDTRANSPORT

[edit] (TS/ISI/IREL) TOYGRIPPE and METROTUBE VPN Analytic

(TS/lSI/lREL) The TURMOIL component that creates metadata records from
all IKE key exchanges forwards ﬁles of these metadata records to the
PRESSUREWAVE database. METROTUBE is a framework for hosting analytic
processes that operate on items in PRESSUREWAVE. The VPN Analytic is a
METROTUBE—hosted process that is triggered when a new ﬁle of VPN
