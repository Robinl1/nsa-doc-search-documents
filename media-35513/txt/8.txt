packets are unwrapped by APEX, recirculated and presented to the VPN
processing components for potential decryption.

a VPN phase 4: ESP dynamic targeting: Based on the value returned by
KEYCARD, the ESP for a particular VPN may be targeted as well.
TURMOIL will send HAMMERSTEIN (via TURBINE) the parameters for
capturing the ESP for the targeted VPN.

[edit] (TS/lSI/IREL) VoIP phases

(TS/[SI/lREL) HAMMERCHANT currently maintains its own list of targeted
VoIP entities. It extracts identities from SIP or H.323 signaling, checks against
its target list, and exﬁls only the voice content for targeted calls. This model
could be expanded in the future using HAMMERSTEIN.

0 VoIP phase 1: HAMMERCHANT Collect: HAMMERCHANT targeted VoIP
RTP exﬁl is captured by TURMOIL. An APEX forwarding component
bundles the voice packets into a ﬁle, attaches appropriate metadata, and
delivers to PRESSUREWAVE. A variant of the passive VoIP analytic will
be triggered to prepare the exﬁl for corporate delivery

a VoIP phase 2: HAMMERCHANT Survey: HAMMERCHANT monitors all
VoIP SIP and H.323 signaling and exﬁltrates all call signaling metadata to
TURMOIL. An APEX component puts the call signaling metadata into an
ASDE record and publishes it to the TURMOIL Asdeeporter component.

0 VoIP phase 3: HAMMERSTEIN: VoIP signaling is captured by
HAMMERSTEIN using port information. The signaling is exﬁled to
TURMOIL and unwrapped. This signaling is then presented to the normal
TURMOIL VoIP processes. The metadata process will create metadata
records for FASCIA. The collection process will extract identiﬁers from
the signaling and check against KEYCARD to decide if the identiﬁers are
targeted. If either calling party identiﬁer or called party identiﬁer is
targeted for active exﬁl, then an extended TURMOIL VoIP component will
extract the ports for the voice conversations and will send this
information as a 5—tuple ﬁlter to HAMMERSTEIN, via TURBINE.

(TS/lSI/IREL) Implementation of the VoIP Phase 2 and 3 processes will be
driven by mission need. The VoIP Phase 3 process should be advantageous in
allowing HAMMERMILL to potentially expand beyond SIP and H.323 VoIP
collection without additional code development in the implant, leveraging
passive processing code.

0 Dataﬂow Phase 1: Dataﬂow tested: Collected IKE is sent to CES

database. Collected targeted data is deposited into PRESSUREWAVE and
analysts can query and view the data.
