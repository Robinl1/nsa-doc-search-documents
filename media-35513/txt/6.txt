[edit] (S/lSI/IREL) APEX mission applications

 

(TS/lSI/lREL) Initial APEX missions are collection via TURMOIL of
HAMMERSTEIN exﬁl of VPN trafﬁc, and HAMMERCHANT exﬁl of targeted
VoIP.

(TS/lSI/lREL) HAMMERSTEIN IPSEC exﬁl is an example of trafﬁc for which
there is an existing TURMOIL passive application. By recirculating the
packets, the passive VPN applications will be engaged to perform their normal
functions, though the packet stream will carry additional metadata related to
the APEX processing.

(TS/lSI/IREL) HAMMERCHANT exﬁl is an example of trafﬁc that is
pre—selected and needs no further selection processing. Furthermore, the VoIP
signaling is not exﬁlled along with the collection,- information such as calling
party and called party are carried as metadata in the FASHIONCLEFT Session
Announcement. Recirculation cannot engage the passive VoIP components to
perform formatting for the backend databases because these passive
processes rely on seeing the SIP or H.323 signaling. The APEX process will
take the HAMMERCHANT sessions, extract needed metadata from the Session
Announcements to attach to the session, and forward directly back to the
PRESSUREWAVE repository for analytic processing.

(TS/lSI/lREL) The initial APEX proof—of—concept missions — HAMMERSTEIN for
VPN and HAMMERCHANT — will develop and demonstrate both of these paths

[edit] (U) APEX Command] Control Development

(TS/lSI/IREL) To enable APEX, both TURMOIL and TURBINE must be supplied
with conﬁguration information and tasking. TURMOIL must have at minimum
an implant ID, the address that this particular implant will put in the
destination address of all its packets (and possibly ports), a key to unwrap the
FASHIONCLEFT protocol, a TAO case notation to assign to the exﬁl, and
appropriate TAO classiﬁcation markings for the exﬁl. Other conﬁguration
metadata for the implant (PDDG, SIGAD, zip codes, etc.) may also be required.

(TS/lSI/IREL) In its end—state, command and control of both the
HAMMERMILL implant and the TURMOIL APEX components will be
performed through TURBINE. TURBINE will be responsible for conﬁguring
the implant with an address to send its trafﬁc to and conﬁguring a receiving
TURMOIL with the parameters it needs to identify and process that mission's
trafﬁc. TURBINE will be able to receive information from TURMOIL
processing of exﬁlled trafﬁc, evaluate using a workﬂow, and deliver updated
tasking to HAMMERMILL. Development to this end—state will occur in three
phases:

0 C&C phase 1: manual conﬁguration: HAMMERMILL is conﬁgured via its
existing command interface. Simultaneously TURMOIL APEX is provided
a conﬁguration ﬁle for this HAMMERMILL mission. A human is
