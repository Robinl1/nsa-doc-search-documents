 

NSAProposal ImplementatiOn:
Use of ICREACH

Current Status:

 

 

(S//REL) ICREACH is an evolving NSA toolkit (middleware)
focused on analyzing the target in a converged telephony-DNI
environment. The federated query searches across all data sets

for information relating to a target identifier.

(S//Sl//REL) For example, through ICREACH an analyst could
find all metadata comms related to a target: phone number,
Global Mobile Satellite and cellular events and selectors,
email address, etc. and any associated locational information.
