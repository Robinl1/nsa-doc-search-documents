. Link layer: BRAVENICKEL project (optical Muxes)

— Copied link is not disguised, just routed on an unused layer 2 path that a
passive collector can monitor

— Selection happens in the passive collector

. Network layer: APEX for HAMMERMILL (routers)

— Router is tasked to select and exfil targeted traffic (perhaps all of a
particular protocol)

— Exfil is disguised (“munged", encrypted) to avoid detection

— Passive collector looks for IP source/destination address in order to
detect the traffic

— If further selection/processing is to be done in collector, the exfil must be
“unwrapped" (unmunged, decrypted)

— Exfil can be directed to passive or to TAO by changing the destination
address
