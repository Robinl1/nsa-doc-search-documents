SIGINT activities, including
material dealing with SIGINT
enabling; cover plans,
programs, and mechanisms;
and/or clandestine SIGINT

of particular cover
mechanisms, are much the
same today as they were prior
to 1968. Revealing the
speciﬁc covert activities
would nullify the particular
programs where they are
successfully used today.
Targets would adopt blanket
denial practices not used
today because they simply do
not appreciate how
NSA/CSS’s covert activities
support SIGINT successes.

GI) Exceptionally grave
damage to national security
can be expected if this
material were to be

 

 

declassiﬁed.

16. CI) TICOM documents dated CONFIDENTIAL/lREL TO 50X1 *75 years GI) TICOM documents
prior to 31 December 1967 USA, FVEY at a minimum 50X3 from date should only be released if
where the acquired document 50X6 of material they would have been
was originally created by the 50X9 released by the U.S. or

U.S. or a Second Party partner
and was in the possession of an
“enemy“ organization.

 

 

 

 

Second Party directly.

GI) TICOM documents that
may be declassiﬁed and
released include acquired
code books and the
description of applications of
techniques to cryptographic
systems.

aJ/lFOUO) TICOM was a
joint Five Eyes effort.
NSA/CSS’s Second Party
partnerships are
extraordinarily close, and in
some cases it is impossible to
tell where one partner’s work
ends and another’s starts. In
many cases, for a variety of
reasons originating within the
respective partner’s
government, Second Party
partners insist that their
involvement in speciﬁc
projects or operations must
not be released. The
UKUSA agreement mandates
that the Second Parties
respect each others’
preferences in these cases.
