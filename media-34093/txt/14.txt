Declassifying ELINT
material that is 50 years old
(and older) would enable
adversaries, who do not
appreciate how well their
signals are currently being
exploited by NSA, to
ascertain those collection and
analysis techniques and
subsequently adopt denial
practices that could preclude
ﬁirther intelligence
exploitation. Such denial
would hamper intelligence of
the modiﬁcation of old
systems as well as the newest
ones.

GI) Serious or exceptionally
grave damage to national
security can be expected if
this material were to be
declassiﬁed, depending on
the particular information

 

 

being revealed.
