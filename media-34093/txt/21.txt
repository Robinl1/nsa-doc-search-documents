released by NSA, that were
collected during and related
to the Cuban Missile Crisis (1
January 1959-31 December
1963), and North
Vietnamese, Laotian, or
Cambodian

communications collected
prior to 31 December 1975,
which are UNCLASSIFIED.

(C//REL TO USA, FVEY)
Releasing decrypts allows the
target to deduce the strength
and range of NSA/CSS’s
capabilities at that time.
When there is direct link
between the cryptologics
used then and those used
today, a straightforward
interpolation would allow the
target who builds and uses
indigenous logics to
determine the minimum
strength required to defeat
NSA/CSS’s diagnosis and
exploitation today. They can
then build and deploy
stronger logics or design and
deploy lo gics using different
crypto-principles than those
used previously. When
commercially available lo gics
were used, the target can buy
stronger lo gics or purchase
from a different supplier,
again with strength and
crypto design principles to
defeat NSA/CSS’s
exploitation.
