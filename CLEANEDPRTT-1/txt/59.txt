meta data. SeeI e.g.t pages 19, 50—51 above. This section
explains the basis for that conclusion.

First, as a general matter, there is no reasonable
expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment in the meta
data to be collected. This conclusion follows directly from the
reasoning of Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735 (1979), which
concerned the use of a pen register on a home telephone line. In
that case, the Supreme Court found that it was doubtful that
telephone users had a subjective expectation of privacy in the
numbers they dialed, id. at 742-43, and that in any case such an
expectation “is not ‘one that society is prepared to recognize as
reasonable.’” id. at 743 (quoting Kat: v. United States, 389 U.S.
347, 361 (1967)). The Court “consistently has held that a person
has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he
voluntarily turns over to third parties," since he “assume[s] the
risk" that the third party would reveal that information to the
government. gg. at 743—44.“ The Co rt found this principle
applicable to dialed phone numbers. regardless of the automated

means by which the call is placed and the “fortuity of whether or

 

” This principle applies even if there is an understanding
that the third party will treat the information as confidential.

United States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435, 443 (1976).
