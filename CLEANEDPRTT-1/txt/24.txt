” The legislative history of the USA PATRIOT Act indicates
that Congress sought to make the definitions of “pen register”

with individual users. The silence of the legislative history on
this point provides no basis for departing from the plain meaning
of the current definitions. See Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co.,
473 U.S. 479, 495 n.13 (1985).
