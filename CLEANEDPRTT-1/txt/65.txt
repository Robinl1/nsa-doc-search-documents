Fourth Amendment.” 414 U.S. at 353 & n.9 (internal quotations
omitted}. The Court rejected this argument, explaining:
The purpose of the Fourth Amendment is to prevent
unreasonable governmental intrusions into the privacy

of one s person, house, papers, or effects.

That wrong . . . is fully accomplished by the original

search without probable cause. Grand jury questions

based on evidence obtained thereby involve no

independent governmental invasion of one’s person,

house, papers, or effects . . . . Questions based on

illegally obtained evidence are only a derivative use

of the product of a past unlawful search and seizure.

They work no new Fourth Amendment wrong.

414 U.S. at 354 (emphasis added); accord United States v.
Verdugo—Urguidez, 494 U.S. 259, 264 (1990); United States v.
Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 906 (1984); see also United States v.
Jacobsen, 465 U.S. 109, 117 (1984) (“Once frustration of the
original expectation of privacy occurs, the Fourth Amendment does
not prohibit governmental use of the now nonprivate
information."}.

In this case, sophisticated analysis of archived meta data
may yield more information abtut a person's Internet
communications than what would at first be apparent.
Nevertheless, such analysis would, like the grand jury
questioning in Calandra, involve merely a derivative use of

information already obtained, rather than an independent

governmental invasion of matters protected by the Fourth
