that have been held to justify searches in the absence of
individualized suspicion. See, e.g., Earls (drug testing of
secondary school students engaged in extracurricular activities);
Michigan Dep't of State Police v. Sitg, 496 U.S. 444 (1990)
(highway checkpoints to identify drunk drivers); Von Raab (drug

testing of Customs Service employees applying for promotion to

sensitive positions); Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives’ Ass’n,

489 U.S. 602 (1989) (drug and alcohol testing of railroad
workers).“ The Government's interest here has even greater
“immediacy" in View of the above-described intelligence reporting
and assessment regarding ongoing plans for large scale attacks
within the United States.

As to efficacy under the Fourth Amendment analysis, the
Government need not make a showing that it is using the least

Int. Surv. Ct. Rev. 2002) (per curiam) (discussing the prevention
of terrorist attacks as a special need beyond ordinary law
enforcement).

" Moreover, the Government's need in this case could be

analogized to the interest in discovering or preventing danger
from “latent or hidden conditions,” which may justify
suspicionless searches. SeeJ e.g., Von Raab, 489 U.S. at 668.
