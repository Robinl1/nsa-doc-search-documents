ambiguity shOuld be resolved in favor of an interpretation of the
definitions of “pen register" and “trap and trace device" that

encompasses the proposed collection.

3. The Proposed Collection is Consistent With Other
Provisions of FISA

Nothing that is fairly implied by other provisions of PISA
governing pen register and trap and trace surveillance would
prevent authorization of the proposed collection as a form of pen
register/trap and trace surveillance. One provision requires
that an order authorizing a pen register or trap and trace
surveillance specify “the identity, if known, of the person to
whom is leased or in whose name is listed the telephone line or
other facility to which the pen register or trap and trace device
is to be attached or applied." 50 U.S.C. § lB42(d)(2}(A)(ii).
Plainly, there is no requirement to state the identity of such a
'person if it is not “known." However, this provision might still
be read to imply that Congress expected that such facilities
would be leased or listed to some particular person, even if the
identity of that person were unknown in some cases. However,
even if Congress had such a general expectation, the language of
the statute does not require that there be such a person for
every facility to which a pen register or trap and trace device

is to be attached or applied. Drawing the contrary conclusion
