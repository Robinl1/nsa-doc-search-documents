or in part by a wire, radio, electromagnetic, photoelectronic or

photooptiCIl system that affects interstate or foreign commerce,

but does not include — (A) any wire or oral communication."5

(2) “Wire communication” is defined at 18 U.S.C. § 2510(1)

as

any aural transfer made in whole or in part through the
use of facilities for the transmission of
communications by the aid of wire, cable, or other like
connection between the point of origin and the point of
reception . . . furnished or operated by any person
Engaged in providing or operating such facilities for
the transmission of interstate or foreign
communications or communications affecting interstate

or foreign commerce.

(3) “Contents" is defined at 18 U.S.C. § 2510(8) to
“include[] any information concerning the substance, purport, or
meaning" of a “wire, oral, or electronic communication."6

While the definitions of “pen register" and “trap and trace

device" each contain several elements, the application of these

 

5 ‘l'he ether exclusions to this definition at S 3510(13) (E)—
(D) are not relevant to this case.

5 Different definitions of “wire communication" and
“contents" are provided at 50 U.S.C. § 1801(1), (n). However,
the definitions set forth in § 1801 apply to terms “[a]s used in
this subchapter," i.e., in 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801—1811 (FISA
subchapter on electronic surveillance), and thus have no bearing
on the meaning of “wire communication” and “contents" as used in
the definitions of “pen register” and “trap and trace device”
applicable to §§ 1841—1846 (separate FISA subchapter on pen
registers and trap and trace devices).
