this case the Court need not, and doas not, decide whether it
would be obliged to accept the applicant’s certification without
any explanation of its basis. Arguing in the alternative, the
Government has provided a detailed explanation of l) the threat

bulk collection described in the application is believed

    
 
    

necessary as a means for NSA

    

3) how that information will contribute to FBI

and 4) what safeguards will be observed to ensure that the

information collected will not be used for unrelated purposes or

Memorandum of Law and Fact at 30 (quoting 3. Rep. No. 105~185, at
27 {1998). However, authorizing the Court to issue an order when
a certification is made, and requiring it to do so without
resolving doubts about the correctness of the certification, are
quite different.

The Government also cites United States v. Hallmark, 911
F.2d 399 (10th Cir. 1990), in arguing that the Court should not
review the basis of the certification. However, the Hallmark
court reserved the analogous issue under Title 18 — “the precise
nature of the court's review under 18 U.S.C. § 3123" of the
relevancy certification in an application for a law enforcement
pen register or trap and trace device — and expressed “no opinion
as to whether the court may, for instance, inquire into the
government’s factual basis for believing the pen register or trap
and trace information to be relevant to a criminal
investigation." id. at 402 n.3.
