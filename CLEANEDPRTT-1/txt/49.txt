WWI-1mm—
the collection of both a huge volume and high percentage of
unrelated communications — is necessary to identify the much
smaller number of—communications.

The Court is persuaded that, in the circumstances of this
case, the scope of the proposed collection is consistent with the
certification of relevance.“ In so finding, the Court concludes
that, under the circumstances of this case, the applicable
relevance standard does not require a statistical “tight fit”
between the volume of proposed collection and the much smaller

proportion of information that will be directly relevant to.

 

“ The Government analogizes this case to ones in which the

Court has authorized overbroad electronic surveillance under 50
U.S.C. §§ 1801-1811. Memorandum of Fact and Law at 42—43. The
Court has authorized the latter form of collection where it is

not technologically possible to acquire

   
 
   

situations are similar in that they both involve collection of an
unusually large volume of non-foreign intelligence information as
a necessary means of obtaining the desired foreign intelligence
information. Yet there are also impOrLent differences between
these cases. An overbroad electronic surveillance under 50
U.S.C. §§ 1801-1811 requires probable cause to believe that the
target is an agent of a foreign power and uses the particular
facility at which surveillance will be directed. § 1805(a){3}.
In this case under 50 U.S.C. §§ 1841—1846, no probable cause
findings are required, and the bulk collection is justified as
necessary to discover unknown persons and
facilities, rather than to acquire communica ions to and from
identified agents of a foreign power. Because of these
differences, the authorization of bulk collection under §§ 1841—
1846 should not be taken as precedent for similar collection of
the full contents of communications under §§ 1801-1811.
