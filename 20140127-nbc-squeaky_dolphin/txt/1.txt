GCHQ, the British signals intelligence agency, prepared the following PowerPoint
slideshow presentation for a top-secret intelligence conference in 2012, revealing a pilot
program called Squeaky Dolphin.

Documents taken from the National Security Agency by Edward Snowden and
obtained by NBC News detail how British cyber spies demonstrated to their US. partners
in 2012 the ability to monitor YouTube and Blogger in real time and collect addresses
from the billions of videos watched daily, as well as some user information, for analysis.
At the time the documents were printed, GCHQ was also able to spy on Facebook and
Twitter. Called “Psychology A New Kind of SIGDEV," (Signals Development), the
presentation includes a section that spells out “Broad real-time monitoring of online
activity” of YouTube videos, URLs “liked” on Facebook, and Blogspot/Blogger visits.
The monitoring program is called “Squeaky Dolphin.”

NBC News is publishing the documents with minimal redactions to protect
individuals. NBC News has also withheld two slides for further review. The last five
pages shown here are from an earlier GCHQ document in 2010. NBC News has added
annotations on two slides in yellow boxes.
