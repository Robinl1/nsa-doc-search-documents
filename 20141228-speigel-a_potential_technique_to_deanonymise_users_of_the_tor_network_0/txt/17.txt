We also include our truth data as a data frame called tortruth. This package is available

9 Conclusion

We have a shown a technique that can deanonymise TOR web—browsing given packet
times between the client and guard node and packet times from the exit node ﬁltered to
a single circuit. The false positive rate looks low enough to suggest this technique should
be carried forward.

The required data is not collected at present. For this technique to work the following
additional data feeds will be required:

0 Second—accurate packet logging at TOR exit nodes we control with packets labelled
by a unique circuit identifier.

o Second—accurate packet logging of sessions between TOR clients and TOR guard
nodes. This data could be obtained by SIGINT or by running guard nodes. The
SIGINT solution would require an up—to—date feed of TOR “consensus” documents;
TOR IP addresses could then be extracted from the “consensus” documents for
filtering by the SIGINT system.

At the time of writing JTRIG are investigating the collection of the exit node data and
ICTR—FSP are trialling a feed of guard node data from research bearers.
Wider testing is recommended to better characterise the false positive rate. A first

test case (both because we have truth data and for InfoSec purposes) may be to try and
deanonymise JTRIG TOR usage.
