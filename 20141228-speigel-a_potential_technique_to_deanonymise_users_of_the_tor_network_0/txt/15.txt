that correlations close to 1 are achieved at time offsets close to 0. The short circuit “2a”
fails to achieve a high correlation. Sensible values for 6 also result, in particular in the
server—to—client direction. The maximum value of the correlation is also shown in table 1
and it can be seen that higher correlations are achieved in the server—to—client direction.

7.2 False positives in the bulk data

We now compare our truth exit traces to the bulk data set and see if we ﬁnd any false
positives. As previously mentioned we’re sliding time to allow as many traces as possible
to be included.

In the server—to—client direction, we can choose a threshold of 0.998 such that we only
miss one true positive whilst having no false positives. The one circuit we miss is “2a"
where the session is short (the main activity is only over 33 seconds). The ROC curve
looks very good. ﬁgure 6.
