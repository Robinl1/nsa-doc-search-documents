Any information collected after a foreign target enters the U.S. —or prior to a discovery that
any target erroneously believed to be foreign was in fact a U.S. person— must be promptly
destroyed unless that information meets specific, limited criteria approved by the Foreign
lntelligence Surveillance Court.

The dissemination of any information about U.S. persons is expressly prohibited unless it is
necessary to understand foreign intelligence or assess its importance; is evidence of a
crime; or indicates a threat of death or serious bodily harm.

The FISC rules of procedure require immediate reporting of any compliance incident. In
addition, the government reports quarterly to the FISC regarding any compliance issues that
have arisen during the reporting period, including updates of previously reported incidents.

The Department ofJustice and Office of the Director of National Intelligence provide a semi-
annual assessment to the Court and Congress assessing compliance with the targeting and
minimization procedures. In addition, the Department ofJustice provides semi—annual
reports to the Court and Congress concerning implementation of Section 702.

An annual Inspector General assessment is provided to Congress, reporting on compliance
with procedural requirements, the number of disseminations relating to U.S. persons, and
the number of targets later found to be located inside the U.S.
