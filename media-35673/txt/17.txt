"Ill

1. No problems with bufferng data since Turmoil does it automatically.
2. No work required to implement cache.

° Cons:

1. Cache is much smaller than 15 minute (900 seconds = 30X 30) CDR
requirement.

l
2. Cache delay is further reduced by unspecified latency to register new DP "."l

— Possibly "mitigated" by sending multiple SA copies in first 30 (or 2) seconds
of exfil.
