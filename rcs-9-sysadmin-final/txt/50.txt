RC5 9 - Space occupied by tagged text in the database

 

Space occupied by tagged text in the database

Each piece of screenshot evidence occupies more space in the database because it is always
accompanied by its tagged text. The increase in space cannot be predicted since it depends on
both the number of screenshots acquired from the agent and the number of words in each
screenshot.

OCR module work load
The OCR module occupies a lot ofthe CPU when converting a screenshot, but is run with a lower
priority than other processes.

Thus the CPU load will only have an effect when the system shows the converted image text
during evidence analysis.

For distributed architecture, it can be installed on Shard and not on the Master Node, already full
of processes.

Symptoms of excessive load

Check how long it takes for the text to be displayed in the single evidence detail and check the
times recorded in the log when acquiring images. If these are deemed excessive and another
server is free (i.e.: that housing another shard database or Master Node) install another OCR
module.

This way the work load will be divided amongst all installed modules.
