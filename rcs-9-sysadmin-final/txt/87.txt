RCS 9 - What you should know about settings

 

What you should know about settings

What you can edit

The following Master Node Collector installation data can be edited:
0 the Master Node nam eflP address
0 System administrator's password

0 backup folder
0 The outgoing mail server to send alert e-mails

When to edit settings

The nam eflP address or password may need to be changed when servers are replaced or simply
due to incorrect data entry during installation.

0 IMPORTANT: specifying a different backup folder, for example on a remote device, is
highly recommended to protect backup data.

Order used to edit settings

Since the server where Master Node is installed is the system "master", the following order must
be followed to change the installation:

1. Change the Master Node name/IP address or password
2. Inform the Collector of the new Master Node name/IP address or password

Mail server settings

The RCS system can be set to send e-mail when the first pieces of evidence is received from a
target. E-mail addressees must have Analyst privileges and belong to the alerting group set for
that operation.

To do this, set the sender settings of the outgoing mail server and, especially, the required
authentication level.
