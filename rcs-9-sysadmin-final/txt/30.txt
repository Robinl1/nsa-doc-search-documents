RCS 9 - USE hardware keys

USB hardware keys

Two hardware keys are included in the package: a main one, already linked to the license in the
USB license key, and a backup, ready to be activated in the event the main key fails.

IMPORTANT: the hardware key must always be connected to the server (to Master
Node in distributed architecture} to allow all RC5 services to run. All services are

immediately aborted when the key is disconnected!

Minimum system requirements

Hardware must be configured as instructed by support service in the contract phase. The
computers on which RC5 is installed require the following characteristics:
