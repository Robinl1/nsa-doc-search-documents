Deleting a component to be monitored
To delete an uninstalled component:

Step Action

 

1 Select the component.

2 Click Delete: RCS will no longer read the status of that component. Only subsequent
installations of new components automatically updates the list.

6 NOTE: erroneously deleting a component that is still installed is not
destructive. Component status will reappear the next time the page is
refreshed.
