OCR module installation

Introduction

The OCR module is an optional module that indexes all content (i.e.: in addition to traditional
documents, also images, audio, video) for full-text search.

0 NOTE: it supports only ASCII characters and left to right reading.

Installation requirements
For all-in-one architecture, install the module on Master Node.

For distributed architecture, install the first OCR module on Shard to avoid increasing the Master
Node work load.

OCR module operations
OCR module operations are described below:

Phase Description

 

1 Screenshot evidence images, awaiting conversion, are saved in a separate queue from
evidence awaiting analysis.

2 The OCR module read the image queue and converts it into text. This operation can last
from one to 5-10 seconds according to the number of words to be acquired.

3 Each image text is saved in the database and tagged as full-text.

4 Storage times and tags for the single image are saved in the module log.

5 The text is made available to the Analyst in the page with the list of evidence for a
search in the Info field and in the detailed evidence page.
