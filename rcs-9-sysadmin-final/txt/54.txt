Anonymizer installation and settings

Introduction

Installing Anonymizers in a chain is optional and is used to redirect data from a group of agents.
The Anonymizer is installed on a server connected to Internet which cannot be reconnected to the
rest of the infrastructure like, for example, a ‘v’PS (Virtual Private Server), rented for this purpose.
Once installed and set up, the Anonymizer communicates its status to the Network Controller

every 30 seconds.
