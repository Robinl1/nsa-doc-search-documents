backups

0 "Technician: in charge of setting up and installing tapping agents
0 Cl. Analyst: in charge of data analysis

‘ Tip: several roles can be assigned to the same user, for exam pl e, an Administrator can
also have Technician privileges.

Admin user and System administrator user

A special user is created during installation with the name "admin" and all privileges (system
administrator, administrator, technician and analyst) to be used for all RCS Console settings and
login functions.

This user must only be used for this purpose. After completing installation, we recommend you
create one or more users with the required privileges according to your organization.

0 IMPORTANT: we usually refer to the admin user in this manual as the System
Administrator, even if shelhe has all privileges.
