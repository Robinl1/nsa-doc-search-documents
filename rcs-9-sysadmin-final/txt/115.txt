Metadata type backup

The metadata backup type is fast and saves the entire system configuration, allowing normal
system operations to be quickly restored in the event of problems. This type of backup does not
include collected evidence. Daily backup is recommended.

WARNING: agents installed on various devices may be lost without a recent metadata
backup.

6 NOTE: thejob that runs weekly metadata backup is set by default and enabled whenever
the system is rebooted. The default job cannot be deleted.

Full type backup

Full backup contains all evidence, therefore this could take a long time. Since it can be restored
after a metadata backup, it is recommended once a month.

Operation type backup

The operation backup saves all open and closed operations. Since it can be restored after a
metadata backup, it is recommended once a month.

Target type backup

The target backup saves all opened and closed target data. Since it can be restored after a
metadata backup, it is recommended once a month.

Incremental backup

Full, operation and target backups can also be incremental. This way the system saves data
generated from the date-time of the last backup. The first incremental backup is always complete
(full, operation or target). Only subsequent backups are incremental.

6 NOTE: if the incremental option is removed and reapplied to a job, the next backup of that
' job will be complete.

‘ Tip: name thejob so it is later recognized as an incremental backup (i.e.: "|ncrem_
lastWeek”).

We suggest you run a complete backup (full, operation or target) once a month and an
incremental backup once a week.
