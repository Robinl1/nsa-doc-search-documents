Check agent status via Collector

Make sure agents are routinely communicating their status to RCS via Network Controller and
that they are sending their data to Collector. Agent data may be lost in the event of a persistent
Collector fault.

Command

In folder C:\RCS\Collector\bin enter rcs—collector-status
Result: the Collector status report appears

'll'lll F

What to check

The Lost sync time must be as recent as possible, compatible with the set synchronization methods
for each agent: a recent Lost sync time indicates that agents correctly communication with
Collector. If Lost sync time is not recent, wait for any other synchronizations to check whether it is
updated. Alternatively, check Collector logs to see whether there are synchronization attempts: in
this case inform support service.

The logs value must be minimum since it is the data saved by the Collector awaiting to be sent to
Master Node. If the value is high, this means that Master Node is not running or is not connected.
Check Master Node service status.

The number of logs will decrease as soon as the connection is resumed.
