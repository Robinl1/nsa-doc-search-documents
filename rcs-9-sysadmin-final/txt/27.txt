RC5 9 - Redirecting login to Collector

Redirecting login to Collector

The Collectors real function can be hidden, for direct access to data collection service, by
redirecting to an unsuspicious page (i.e.: Google, e-commerce site and so on). Redirecting is
through a customizable HTM L page.

See "Files installed at the end of installation " on page 35

Digital certificates

Master Node uses HTTPS digital certificates that guarantee communication security between
Master Node, Collector, Network Controller and RCS Consoles.

Some agents (Android, Symbian) require specific certificates that must be created and saved in
folder \RCS\DB\config\certs.

Decoding data

Worker service is installed with each Shard and decodes data before it is saved in the database.
For distributed databases, each Shard has its own Worker that receives encrypted data from
Master Node, decodes it and saves it in the database. The work load is automatically evenly
distributed among all Shards in the same cluster.
