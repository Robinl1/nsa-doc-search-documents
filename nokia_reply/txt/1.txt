Dear Dr. Tynan

| write in response to your letter to Stephen Elop of August 19, 2013. As you noted in your letter, at
Nokia we take the privacy of our customers seriously.

Our devices are designed so that when they are switched off, the radio transceivers within the devices
should be powered off. We are not aware of any way they could be re-activated until the user switches
the device on again. We believe that this means that the device could not be tracked in the manner
suggested in the article you referenced.

Some processes inside devices may continue to operate when the device has been switched off by the
user, for as long as there is power available to them. This is consistent with the behaviour of other con-
sumer electronic devices, such as laptops, tablets and games consoles. One example would be the real
time clock, which ensures that when the device is switched on again the user does not have to re-enter
the correct time. Another example would be the phone’s charging circuits. Depending on the model,
connecting or disconnecting chargers including USB cables, or placing the phone on a wireless charging
plate, may cause the device to register the change in charging state and display that to the user, for
example by showing a charging symbol on the screen. This would not, however, change the status of
the radio components.

Consumers who are concerned about the privacy of their devices can visit

Yours sincerely
