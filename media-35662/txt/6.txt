QUANTUM EXPLOIT

After extensive testing of the QUANTUM tipping and redirection to the
SHORTSHEET exploitation server by the Joint CNE/TECA Mobile
Exploitation Team, further target development work was needed to
identify iPhone targets recently seen active on the appropriate user
agents. Bulk extraction of targets over a three-week period from
BLACKHOLE by ICTR resulted in a large number of iPhone targets and
further queries in Xkeyscore resulted in others. Others were passed from
discussions with various lPTs and two were also passed from TAO
contacts.

In total 44 selectors were checked to verify that the correct user agent
was present. Of these 44 selectors, 41 were yahoo selectors and 3 gmail
selectors. Of these 26 were seen with a valid iPhone Safari user agent
as shown in Figure 8. A summary of 08 versions seen with target
phones is shown in Table l with OS highlighted in red currently
exploited. These are 3_l_2, 3_l_3 and 4_0_1. In all 26 cases, the target
analysts were contacted with details regarding their targets use of an
exploitable iPhone.

Table l — iPhone target 08 summary

One particular case was a target,— with yahoo
selector that was seen active on a iPhone OS

3_l_2. as shown in Figure 8. The resulting Yahoo-B cookie is

and as can be seen the target has been active off

. Running the resulting Yahoo-

B cookie through MUTANT BROTH resulted in 171 events primarily on
case notations GWUKGOOS, GWVCBOOS and IRUKCOB6. The resulting
information was then forwarded to the analysts in the-team for
tasking by the standard CNE process as outlined in the Good
Penetration Guide [d].
