TOP SECRET STRAP1
12th November 2010

CNE are now conducting monthly surveys of all target machines registry
keys for iPhone UDle. A similar tipping mechanism for all BROADOAK
hits needs to be completed using a XKS workflow. Hopefully, other
targets will be added for QUANTUM exploitation or discovered on new
CNE SEPs in the future and a successful exploit of a target phone
performed.

FURTHER WORK

Analysis of three PRESTON accesses has resulted in the identification
of a number of iPhone targets. Development work against at least three
target sets is needed with extraction of appropriate UDle and iTunes
XDSID values. Suitable section 5 warrants need to be in place to pursue
these end point machines. once CNE have gained access and the
resulting target iPhones have been discovered.

With further work being undertaken by 888 and TECA on the
WHIPSAW redirect and exploitation server, it should be possible in the
coming months to implant directly the target iPhone. However, the
WHIPSAW exploit is only available via the tasked ADSL line.

An automatic implantation of SLIDE on to an iPhone is needed.
Currently this is manual process requiring a CNE operator to be
connected to the endpoint machine whilst the target is syncing the end
point machine and iPhone.

A larger number of iPhone TDls need to be written to allow further
events to be populated into the QFDs allowing correlations with other
target selectors. This will also enable further real-time tracking of target
identifiers.
