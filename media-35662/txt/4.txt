7. The target UDID can be used track the iPhone seen with ASBOLINE
EPILSON end point machine. In this particular case the tar et UDID has
been seen 16 times, the last time off Pi on the
24/10/10 using the inbuilt iPhone Mail client to access his yahoo

account. The user agent for this is shown in Figure 3. In this case the
EAUTO_App|e-imei-URI TDI rule was used to extract the specific UDID

 

value.

8. The UDID for all 6 targets were run through AUTOASSOC. The result for
is shown in Figure 5. As can be seen there is a clear

correlation with the — yahoo-Y-cookie.

9. The IP address. identifier type, bearer and user agent type for all 6
targets was extracted and formed the basis of further target development
work. Running the resulting 6 UDle through AUTOASSOC, resulted in
two correlations with a high enough score. These were
and—and confirmed to be correct after discussing with
