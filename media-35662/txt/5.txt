TOP SECRET STRAP1
12th November 2010

the _ Checking BROADOAK tasking revealed that both targets
had known associated iPhone lMEls already tasked.

A recent rescan of all currently active CNE SEPs resulted in only 5 of the
9 identified CNE machines actually being available for exploit. The other
4 implants having been removed. Of these five UDle, four returned with
correlated UDle that had recently been seen in passive collection.
These are contained in the iPhone target list [f].

Analysis of all TAO SEPs resulted in 116 UDle being identified. Of
these UDle, 15 were correlated with iPhone user agents and the
resulting identifier type, project name, case notation and IP noted. A full
list is available in the iPhone target list [f]. Of these four had the Cydia
user agent as shown in Figure 6 indicating the target had jailbroken their
phone. All four end points were located in

The same 15 TAO UDle were run through AUTOASSOC and resulted

in three ood correlations with yahoo selectors —

turn confirmed to be correct correlations with TAO target end points and
two showed associated target iPhone lMEls. Further, analysis of the
Yahoo mail used via the Safari browser clearly showed the resulting
UDID was transmitted in traffic.
