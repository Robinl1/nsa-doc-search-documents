TOP SECRET STRAP1
12th November 2010

Using an open source PDF vulnerability when using the Safari browser,
Joint CNE/TECA Mobile Exploitation Team were able to develop an
exploit to deliver a WARRIORPRIDE implant to a target test phone.
Further, investigation, liaison and testing with the CNE QUANTUM team
resulted in approval for the implant to be deployed against QUANTUM
iPhone targets.

DESCRIPTION OF ANALYSIS

CNE Endpoint

TDI

As part of the SD Mobile Exploitation theme to identify further end point
machines that had been seen syncing with iPhones. a survey was
undertaken by CNE and TAO to scan all target end point machines for
the appropriate iPhone registry keys. Scanning of all CNE stored single
end point (SEPs) registry keys on particular process IDs resulted in 9
CNE endpoints seen this year sync’d with iPhones. The resulting Unique
Device Identifiers (UDID) were extracted from the registry keys and ran
in MUTANT BROTH and AUTOASSOC, resulting in 6 correlations with
either iPhone Safari user agents or the iPhone Mail app seen in passive
collection.

A CNE end point operation against—(ABSOLINE

EPILSON had resulted in access to a windows end point machine
. A scan of this machine‘s re istr keys resulted in UDID
. As can be seen, the

UDID has been seen with the Admob SEM rule type and with the Apple-
lMEl-URI TDI type. Admob is the largest mobile advertising network
allowing games publishers to embed adverts and therefore receive
revenue from a number of different brands. The target iPhone OS is 3_0
as shown in the User Agent profile in figure 2.
