iPhone target analysis and exploitation with unique
device identifiers

  

Summary

This paper describes standard analysis techniques
that have been used to both discover iPhone
target end point machines and implant target
iPhones directly using the QUANTUM system. It
shows that the iPhone Unique Device Identifier
(UDID) can be used for target tracking and can be
used to correlate with end point machines and
target phone. It highlights the exploits currently
available and the CNE process to enable further
targeting.
