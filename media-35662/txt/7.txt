Figure 8 —Valid iPhone Safari user agent in MB (-<yahoo>)

The target— with target selector

was seen active on different iPhone OS
and more recently on an iPad. Three other targets were seen active on
iPads and two others on iPods but with no other associated iPhone
device. Of the 44 targets seen, 16 were seen using the iPhone Mail
client that comes by default with all 08. A total of 7 targets were seen
using the Yahoo Mobile Messenger app.

For all target selectors seen with valid Safari user-agents, further
MUTANT BROTH, AUTOASSOC and MARINA queries were performed
to discover any other possible 08 versions seen with the selector.
MARINA profile queries were performed resulting in the OS version
being returned within the MachinelD field. The resulting user-agents,
timeldate, bearer, IP and any other associated selectors are shown in
the iPhone target list [f]. Associated selectors are either from MUTANT
BROTH, AUTOASSOC or seen directly as stated in BROADOAK. All
Yahoo B-cookies as shown in Figure 8 were run in MUTANT BROTH to
confirm their uniqueness with the iPhone and target yahoo selectors.

OPERATIONAL OUTCOME

The QUANTUM redirect and PDF Safari browser exploit was developed
to work against 3_1_2, 3_1_3 and 4_0_1 Safari 08 versions. Of the 26
targets seen with valid exploitable OS version, 5 were added to the
QUANTUM system for targetting.

Once notified, GCHQ lPTs either added the target to existing CNE
section 7 warrants as defined in [e] or developed targetting aids as
defined in [d] and wrote the appropriate warrant. The resulting section 7
warrants were approved by IPT team leaders and signed off by the ONE
Legal Team. Three NSA targets were discovered and were added by
CNE Legal Team to the Partner Agreement Forms to allow exploitation.

Initially,—yahoo selector and B-
cookie was put on cover on QUANTUM. was not seen

active recently on a iPhone Safari browser to access his yahoo account,
preferring instead to use the inbuilt iPhone Mail client or his iPad. Three
QUANTUM attempts resulted in no redirect to SHORTSHEET server for
