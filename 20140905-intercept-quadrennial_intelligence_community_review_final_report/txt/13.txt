(U) CONCEPTS FOR INTELLIGENCE IN 2025

(U) To cope with the challenging missions emerging from the four scenarios summarized in the ﬁgure on page 2,
QICR developed six concepts (see ﬁgure below) that point to a need for further exploration and potential investment.
Some of these concepts will be critical across the full spectrum of possible futures and thus are termed ”safe bets”
because they merit the most urgent attention for further development and investment. Other concepts will be highly
relevant in a narrower range of future operating environments, although aspects ofthe concept may have wider ap-
plication. These concepts are termed ”strategic hedges,” and merit further exploration for investment in the event
that future developments point toward their increasing importance. Together, these concepts and their associated
sample key capabilities highlight how the management, organization, and practice of intelligence must evolve to
cope with the range of alternative futures the IC may confront. The IC will need to develop innovative approaches,
potentially including some adaptation ofthe legal and/or policy framework under which the IC operates.
