interest that was not tasked at the time of the original call. Analyst
retrievals should be based on metadata, SRI found in FASCIA, that'll
indicate there's a target of interest that's been detected in
SCALAWAG's environment. Once the audio is identified, retrieved, and
forwarded to your NUCLEON account, analysts would then consider
tasking the number in UTT at ECP 1-3, based on the critical need for
the data.

(S//Sl//REL TO USA, FVEY) Retrieval and fonNarding via the RETRO
TOOL will significantly reduce bandwidth and latency issues. It will also
likely result in getting the audio data back to your NUCLEON account
more quickly than if tasked at ECP 4 and below. We strongly request
that TOPls do not artificially inflate the priority of their tasking just to
get numbers tasked. SlGDEV/Target development should be
accomplished using the RETRO TOOL and subsequent tasking occur
based on SlGDEV. TOPls should make use of the RETRO TOOL
whenever possible to retrieve the desired audio content. We do not
have the luxury of task and forget.
