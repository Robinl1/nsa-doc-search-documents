(U) Tasking of SCALAWAG

(TS//Sl//REL TO USA, FVEY) SCALAWAG/US-331OBG has long since
reached the point where it was collecting and sending home far more
than the bandwidth could handle. Over collecting has significantly
increased the latency of pri 1-2 content data. Because SCALAWAG is
NSA's #1 provider of actionable SIGINT on [REDACTED COUNTRY
NAME], measures had to be taken to alleviate pressure on the
bandwidth and decrease latency of priority 1-2 data. In the summer of
2011, in an effort decrease the amount of voice content brought home,
SSO deleted a large quantity of priority 4 and below tasking that was
bringing content and according to the DOUBLEARROW database had
not been "touched". Additionally, a change of priority 4 tasking to
priority 6 was effected, again based on DOUBLEARROW results. As a
result, the latency for primarily pri 1-2 had dropped considerably.
However, these actions were still falling short because the volume of
collection was increasing

(S//S|//REL TO USA, FVEY) On 15 December 2011, SSO collection
and program management implemented a rule for SCALAWAG UTT
tasking, that basically does not allow any "Effective Collection Priority"
(ECP) pri 4 and below tasking. It must be understood that the priority
of tasking in UTT IS NOT the same and straightforward as OCTAVE.
Analysts must choose fields whose net result is priority 1-3.
Additionally, all UTT ECP pri 4 and below tasking was deleted. Since
implementation, some TOPIS may have noted a decrease total volume
in their SCALAWAG collection delivered to their NUCLEON accounts.
Many SCALAWAG users are familiar with and have access to the
RETROSPECTIVE retrieval tool (RETRO TOOL). The RETRO tool is
a unique one-off capability that exists only at SCALAWAG. It allows
analysts to go nominally 30-days into the past and retrieve audio of
