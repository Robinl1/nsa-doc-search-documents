Direct, high-level tasking
- Where active tasking already in use,
refine what is collected
- If no CNE, pursue active collection

 
  
 

 
 
 

 

 

Note: Our goals for high-level tasking are to relieve the user
ﬁ'om needing to know I care about the details. For example, a
user should be able to ask for "all details about application X"
and not need to know how and where the application keeps
ﬁles, registry entries, user application data, etc.
