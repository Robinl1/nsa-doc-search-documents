(TS/lSI/lREL) Update the MOPNGO application to remove the buffer overﬂow
issue it has when more than 512 characters are configured. Also, port this
application to JUMPDOLLAR. Create a ROGUESAMURAI test suite to test the
application. Look into creating unit tests as well.

[edit] (TS/lSI/IREL) NTFSD DOS Driver

(TS/lSI/lREL) The MX team has requested an upgrade of their NTFSD DOS
driver for their DOS—based thumb drives used in interdiction deployments.
The newest FSM should be compiled into a DOS driver for their use. This
problem will be solved with the creation of a MKUSB utility for
JUMPDOLLAR.

[edit] (U) Full Featured Shell

(TS/lSI/lREL) A full featured shell should be written (particularly for
JUMPDOLLAR). The ability to run scripts and have some sort of ﬂow control
logic would be desirable. This could eventually be used by the MX team as a
means to deploy implants. They have expressed a desire to have one
environment that can work on a Mac, Linux, or a Windows machine. Provided
we have the file system support, this could eventually provide them what
they want.

[edit] (TS/ISI/IREL) Windows Registry
Read/Write Capability

(TS/lSI/lREL) Create the ability from SIERRAMIST/JUMPDOLLAR to be able
to read and write the Windows registry. This will provide new capability to
apps to do a whole host of new things. It may be possible to install
VALIDATOR manually instead of relying on its installers. This work may also
allow some IT Geo applications as well if we can tweak some keys.

[edit] (TS/lSI/IREL) EFI Module

(TS//SI//REL) Build an EFI module out of SIERRAMIST/JUMPDOLLAR apps
that can be loaded via normal EFI mechanisms including an EFI shell. This is
similar to what Sandia can do with their MOUSETRAP implant. This work
could provide a new mechanism to achieve persistence and might prove to be
easier than current patching techniques.

[edit] (TS/lSI/IREL) Linux App

(TS/lSI/lREL) Rewrite the Linux App to be configurable and add logging into
it for use with IRATEMONK. Integrate build into BORGERKING. Investigate
