[edit] (TS/lSI/lREL) CNA Team
POLITERAIN

(TSI/SII/REL FVEY) TAO/ATO Persistence POLITERAIN(CNA) team is looking
for interns who want to break things. We are tasked to remotely degrade or
destroy opponent computers, routers, servers and network enabled devices
by attacking the hardware using low-level programming. It would be
expected that our interns would learn to:

o (Ul/FOUO) Write drivers for LINUX, Windows, Solaris, or Apple OS.

0 (U/lFOUO) Use SVN in a group environment.

0 (TS/[SI//REL) Reverse engineer embedded systems

0 (TS/ISI//REL) Deliver code that conforms to Op—sec and deniability
requirements.

0 (TS/[SI//REL) Recover equipment that has been attacked.

o (Ul/FOUO) Work with multiple SME's to build something unique.

0 (TS/[SI//REL) Developing an attacker's mind set.

(TSl/SII/REL FVEY) POLITERAIN always has a backlog of smaller attacks
than those listed below that need to be productized. We are also always open
for ideas but our focus is on ﬁrmware, BIOS, BUS or driver level attacks. The
projects below an intern could be expected to produce results in 4-6 months.
Most of the projects are unique enough to allow for results to be briefed or
published in a classiﬁed venue.

[edit] (U) PASSIONATEPOLKA

(TSI/SI/lREL FVEY)We have discovered a way that may be able to remotely
brick network cards. We need someone to perform research and develop a
deployable tool. Intern would have access to driver level developers, mentors
