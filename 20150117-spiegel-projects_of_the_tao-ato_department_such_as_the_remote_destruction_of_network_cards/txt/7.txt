will more than likely require a refactoring of how the conﬁguration data
of CASTLECRASHER is stored.

o (TS/ISI/IREL) Develop an automated test suite using the Persistence
Division's ROGUESAMURAI test framework to provide more robust
testing for this important project.

[edit] (TS/ISI/IREL) Alternate Windows
Execution Technique

(TS/ISIl/REL) Currently, CASTLECRASHER is the only production quality
Windows execution technigue that Payload Persistence technigues have.
Another mechanism to execute DNT payloads is needed. Most pre—boot
Persistence techniques only have the ability to inﬂuence an OS through
modiﬁcations to the target file system. Work needs to be done to investigate
other ways to get execution inside of Windows. This work will start looking at
other techniques that have been provided to the Persistence Division from
other partners. The feasibility of these techniques should be assessed. If
feasible, the technique should be productized into a deployable solution.

[edit] (TS/ISI/IREL) Mac OSX Execution
Technique

(TS/ISIl/REL) Research needs to be done to investigate different ways that a
pre—boot Persistence technique that can modify the target ﬁle system can get
execution inside of OSX. Maybe start—up scripts can be modiﬁed or special
ﬁles can be added that will get executed. In order for Payload Persistence to
work against OSX, a execution technique is needed.

SIERRAMIST/JUMPDOLLAR

[edit] (U) Extensibility Application

(TS/ISIl/REL) Create a new extensibility application that checks for a ﬁle on
the ﬁle system that it will run to update the SIERRAMIST partition. This
application would replace the current one and would have list of conﬁgurable
file paths to check. This could be written for both SIERRAMIST and
JUMPDOLLAR. Create a ROGUE SAMURAI test suite to test all aspects of this

app.
