Sc SMEs but would own the project and be responsible for it.

[edit] (U) ARGYLEALIEN

(TSl/SI/lREL FVEY)There is a security feature built into many modern
hard—drives that allows for zeroization. We want to use this feature to cause
the loss of data. Intern would be working closely with a POLITERAIN
engineer to develop a solution that would work on multiple vendors
leveraging Persistence divisions SMEs, investigating via experimentation.
Intern would learn about hard—drive recovery, reverse engineering,
hard—drive architecture and much more.

[edit] (U) BARNFIRE

(TSl/Sll/REL FVEY)This attack effort will erase the BIOS on a brand of
servers that act as a backbone to many rival governments. An intern working
on this project would need to be a *nix expert with experience with low—level
development experience of multiple types and reverse engineering
experience. Intern would be working and learning from SMEs during this
development. First tour interns would not be considered for this project.

[edit] (U) Hard Drive Recovery

(TSl/SI/lREL FVEY) When someone really needs the information off of a
damaged hard drive, they call Persistence. This would be a unique tour
learning from a world—class expert how to ﬁx hardware and ﬁrmware
problems. You would be working on targets, extracting data, troubleshooting
hardware, rebuilding SCSI arrays, and using analytical engineering skill to
produce real collection. Position requires good hearing for some of the
troubleshooting. Intern should know how to solder.

[edit] (U) IRATEMONK
[$1 (TS/lSI/IREL) SSD Support

(TS/[SII/REL) Integrate SSD research into IRATEMONK products. This will
involve 4 different parts:

0 (TS/lSI/lREL) Leveraging research to create ARM-based SSD implant.
This works involves reverse engineering SSD ﬁrmware and creating C
and ARM assembly code to place inside of a ﬁrmware image to
implement the IRATEMONK algorithm.

0 (TS/lSI//REL) Create version of the IMBIOS code that supports the SSD
implant. This code runs on the x86 host and involves writing both C and
