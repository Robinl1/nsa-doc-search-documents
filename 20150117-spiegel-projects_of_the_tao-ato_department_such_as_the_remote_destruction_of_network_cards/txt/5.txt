[edit] (U/IFOUO) FAKEDOUBT Support

(TSI/SII/REL) Create an IRATEMONK implementation for ARM—based Hitachi
drives. This includes a firmware implant, IMBIOS code, and WICKEDVICAR
and SPITEFULANGEL support.

[edit] (Ul/FOUO) PLUCKHAGEN Support

(TSI/SII/REL) Create an IRATEMONK implementation for ARM—based Fujitsu
drives. This includes a ﬁrmware implant, IMBIOS code, and WICKEDVICAR
and SPITEFULANGEL support.

[edit] (U/IFOUO) EASYKRAKEN Support

(TS//SI//REL) Add more drive support for ARM—based Samsung drives.

[edit] (TS/lSI/IREL) USB Hard Drive
Persistence

(TSI/SII/REL) Develop a capability to install a hard drive implant on a USB
hard drive. Since external hard drives are not normally boot from, the new
implant will need to be an improved version of MADBISHOP so the hard
drive implant will have the ability to manipulate the ﬁle system of the drive
inside of the ﬁrmware itself. Development would consist of 3 main
development areas:

- (TS/lSI//REL) Reliable, robust, and portable NTFS C code. Other ﬁle
systems could also be looked into such as FAT, EXTZ, etc.

0 (TS/[Sll/REL) Hard drive implant

0 (TS/lSI/lREL) Remote installation over USB

[egﬂt] (TS/lSI/IREL) IRATEMONK on
Server/RAID Systems

(TS/[SII/REL) Investigate the feasibility of developing a hard drive
persistence implant for Server/RAID systems. This will primarily involve
investigating what ATA commands are allowed through various RAID
controllers. Also, coming up with a scheme to handle different RAID
configurations will be needed since the data on the drives will differ
depending on the the RAID setup. It will be important to examine how RAID
controllers interact the drives and where data (especially the MBR) is stored.
If feasible, this investigation could lead to the extension of IRATEMONK—type
