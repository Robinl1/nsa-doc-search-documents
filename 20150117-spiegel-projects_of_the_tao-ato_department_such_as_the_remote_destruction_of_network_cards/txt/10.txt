- (TS/lSI/IREL) BENTWHISTLE — A collection tool that runs from
BERSERKR.

(TS/[Sll/REL) BERSERKR is often looking to expand its target support. A big
way this is done is via adding network card support. Currently, BERSERKR
does not support any wireless network cards.

[edit] (U/IFOUO) GOPHERRAGE

(TS/[Sll/REL) GOPHERRAGE is a project that seeks to develop a hypervisor
implant that would leverage both AMD and Intel's virtualization technology
in order to provide both DNT implant persistence capabilities and a
persistent back door.

(TS/[SI/[REL) Deve10p a hypervisor implant that would leverage both Intel's
and AMDs virtualization technology in order to provide both DNT implant
persistence capabilities and a persistent back door access. The idea would be
similar to what BERSERKR can do from SMM in that it should be able to use
"the machine's network interface card (NIC) to communicate independently
of the host operating system (08)". Also, this hypervisor implant should have
full read/write access of host memory so it will be possible to change Host
OS behavior in ways that could allow code execution, OS injection, system
survye, VM break—in, etc.

(TS/[Sll/REL) GOPHERRAGE is the Persistence Division's pilot program to
apply industry best practices and agile deve10pment processes to internal
projects. To this end, the project is managed via the Scrum process. Test
Driven Development (TDD) practices are used as well in an effort to reduce
code defects. The project also is looking to incorporate ideas from DNT such
as their SCube build environment.

[edit] (U/IFOUO) ‘Windows Tools
[edit] (U/IFOUO) WISTFULTOLL

 

(TS/ISIl/REL) WISTFULTOLL is the premiere target survey tool for Windows
that runs on almost all targets automatically. It brings back information
about the target system's machine and Operating system that is invaluable

for both the Persistence Division and analysts enterprise wide. New features
need to be added to WISTFULTOLL as well as it being refactored.

[edit] (U/IFOUO) CENTRICDUD

 

(TS/ISIl/REL) CENTRICDUD is a tool to read and writes bytes in the CMOS.
