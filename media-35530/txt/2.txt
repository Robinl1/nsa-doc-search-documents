c. Can a Skype user have more than one skypeMailToken?

c.i. Yes - they can link 2 or more email addresses to their account... each has a
corresponding skypeMailToken. You can query DECODEORDAIN to find out
what e-mail address they correlate to.

d. ls there any benefit (or harm) to tasking both the SkyUser and SkypeHash for
the same user to PRISM?

d.i. Tasking a SkypeUser automatically tasks the SkypeHash to UTT. The only
time you need to explicitly task a SkypeHash is when you don't know what
the correlated SkypeUser is (i.e. querying DECODEORDAIN with the
SkypeHash fails to return a correlated SkypeUser. and after you've contacted

nd they fail to find a correlated SkypeUser).
