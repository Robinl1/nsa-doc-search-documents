Scenario C is an interesting case -- it implies that the target is talking to
himself. In fact. he is... This scenario occurs when the target uses 2 different
devices (i.e. laptop and mobile phone. or laptop & desktop. etc), and is
logged in from both devices at the same time.

These 2 devices will automatically "synch" with each other. and transmit
information between them (including past communications that the target
was a party to).

Now - when it comes to multi-parti communications (conference calls. multi-
person IMs. etc.). Skype is still a peer-to-peer protocol (l-to-l). Skype
creates a mesh-network, where users are connected together through
multiple peer-to-peer links. Instant Messages sent to this group of meshed
participants can be routed *through* any participant. For example, ifA. B.
and C are chatting together in a conference chat, the peer-to-peer network
may look like this: A <-—> B <--> C. In this scenario, IM's from Ato B and C
will all be routed through B. If B is our target. we will see these IM's... but B is
a party to these IMs - because they're multi-party IMs (not private IMs
between A and C).
