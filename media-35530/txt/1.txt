(TS/lSl/INF) User’s Guide For PRISM Skype Collection

August 2012
POC For Document:_ 83531

1. (TSl/Sll/NF) Introduction
3. PRISM Skype collection can be identified by the following:

a.i. SIGAD: US-984XN (this SIGAD is used for all PRISM collection, notjust
Skype collection).

a.ii. Case Notation: P7*, where the * represents awildcard.

b. Sustained Skype collection began in Feb 2011 against “in and out” modes; this is
the mode in which one end of the call is using a Skype application, and the other
end is using a landline, or cell phone, without a Skype application. This is audio
only. PRISM collection added exploitation against peer-to-peer Skype applications
in July 2011. In this mode, both/all users are using the Skype application. This can
be a mixture of audio, video, chat, and file transfers. PRISM collection can be from
both modes of communication; however, there is no distinction made in the Case
Notation.

c. PRISM collection is available for “surveillance” tasking in UTT. There is no “stored
comms" or “search" capability for tasking.

2. (TSl/Sll/NF) Questions on tasking Skype Selectors to PRISM:
a. Can I task something other than SkypeUser?

a.i. No - this is your only option for Skype selectors in PRISM. You cannot task
skypeMailToken.

b. Do I need to include a V-Sen'es zipcode?

b.i. Yes. When you submit FAA Skype requirements, please remember to include
a V-series zipcode — otherwise, voice content will not be routed to
NUCLEON.
