H. The reason why you're seeing pieces of Skype chats in different documents is for 3
reasons:

1) the data is too big, and is being fragmented into multiple documents (this isn't
that common, however)

2) Skype sends chunks of old conversations to synchronize conversation histories
across multiple Skype installations. These old conversations are sent piecemeal
across multiple chat sessions.

3) Every time a Skype user disconnects from Skype, and reconnects again - they
being a new session. It's common to see Skype users disconnect & reconnect
frequently whenever Skype stops performing well for them (i.e. if their video or
audio messes up, it's common to see a Skype user disconnect & reconnect to get it
working again). Every time they do this, a new PINWALE document is started.

Items 2 and 3 are based entirely on target behavior (it's not a collection problem,
and is not being introduced by NSA).

m. Why does my Skype playback get out of sync?

m.i. The main issue is data-loss causing the audio to skip and fall-behind. CES is
working on a few techniques to help keep the audio in-sync between channels and
with the video (the video should always be in-synch, since we timestamp each video
frame).

4. (TS/ISIIINF) Questions on miscellaneous issues:

a. How do l ﬁnd out the e-mall address of my Skype target? The collection only
gives me the Skypeuser, SkypeNode and SkypeMallToken.

a.i. Email addresses are not included in Skype collection... skypeMailTokens
(which are derived from email addresses) are. You can search MARINAfor
skypeMailToken - to - SkypeUser correlations to detect a username change,
in order to put new SkypeUser selectors up on FAA coverage. You can also
transform any email address into a skypeMailToken using
DECODEORDAIN. DECODEORDAIN can also transform some
skypeMailTokens back into email addresses. For cases where
DECODEORDAIN cannot transform a skypeMailToken into an email address
- please send an email to—and request that they attempt
to recover the email address from the skypeMailToken (however, please only
do this if DECODEORDAIN fails to return the email address).

b. Can we collect Skype volcemall?
b.i. If a target connects via a peer-to-peer connection, we will not be able to
collect any voicemail he receives or sends. If a target connects via a PSTN
connection and uses his InlOut number to communicate with another user’s
