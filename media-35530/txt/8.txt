have to worry about SkypeCredCRC's. because CES Protocol Exploitation is
able to map them to SkypeUser's... but there are a handful of edge cases
where they don't have enough information to do so. Also, a SkypeUser can
have more than 1 SkypeCredCRC associated with them. So - the possibility
that a SkypeCredCRC shows—up in your collection and is associated with
one of the already-existing communicants in the collection is a very possible
(although it's not universally true). CES only "holds-up" collection for a
certain period of time before they give-up trying to figure-out how to map an
unknown SkypeCredCRC to a SkypeUser (12 hours would be too long... that
would build-in a 12-hour delay into all Skype collection before you got to see

it). If you run into a Sk eCredCRC and cannot figure out who it is, just send
an email to h and someone (either in PE, or
880) can try and figure-out if we (or the FBI) has learned the correlation

after-the-fact. It is not possible for you to see the correlation in the raw data.
Encryption is used to mask the correlation.

f. How does Skype work?

f.i. Skype is a true "peer to peer" service... communications are not routed
between central servers - they are only routed between Skype users (i.e.
“peers"). NSA receives Skype collection via PRISM when one of the peers is
a FAA/702 tasked target.

There are 3 collection scenarios:
A) target --> other_person
B) other_person --> target

C) target --> same_target

Scenario A and B occur when a target is communicating with another
individual. This communication may not be very interesting (i.e. it might not
be an IM, Voice, or Video... it mayjust be a request to retrieve that
individual's Avatar to display)... but there was *some* type communication
between these two users, and the target is a party to that communication.
