b.i.l. By selecting the "General Skype“ permutation, you will query all
Skype PRISM traffic (regardless of whether there is any content or not
)

b.i.2. By selecting only the "Skype Chat“ permutation, you will narrow
the query to only Skype PRISM traffic that contains Instant Messaging
content

b.i.3. By selecting only the "Skype Webcam“ permutation, you will
narrow the query to only Skype PRISM traffic that contains at least
one visible video stream

b.ii. Please note that when MARINA says that a SkypeUser webcammed with
another user... that event *did* actually happen - but the content may not be
visible in PINWALE (because part of the video stream may have been lost,
prohibiting us from being able to reconstruct the video). If you want to look
for PINWALE documents that have webcams that are actually visible, you
can use the DECODEORDAlN-enabled PINWALE query option, described
above.

c. My Skype PINWALE out says "PRINTAURA Skype" - what does that mean?
c.i. The display name is “PRINTAURA Skype” for both the UIS Text Presenter

and the DNI Presenter. The DNI Presenter and UIS Text Presenter both
have the capability to display SKYPE; Chat, File Transfers, and Video. The
DNI Presenter has a single combined display for SKYPE webcam that allows
the user to play the video and audio together in a synchronized mode or
individually. Within UIS, the user will need to use UIS Hotzone to play the
corresponding audio cuts.

d. How do I search for Skype data in NUCLEON?
