Refine Tasking Task.11 Reguest inetwork info e.g. traceroutes, ipconfig, arp - a. STARGATE (Manual authorisation tool)
possible YOU“? -print, netmap STARGATE (Network visualisation)
Experiment Tasking Task.13 Mission management: within the EndPoint system - on file STARGATE (Chequerboard)
request, generate metrics I stats - TPA can use LOOKING GLASS
Refine Tasking Task.14 Access to cookie content. These are powerful sigint STARGATE
enablers, carrying selector and geolocation information
amongst other stuff. so rank ihigher than other webbrowsing
material.
Experiment Tasking Task.15 Tasking by application e.g. "get me all Skype files" STARGATE (Endpoint data characterisation)
Experiment Tasking Task.16 Tasking by files containing a string I having particular hash STARGATE (Endpoint data characterisation)
values I image hash values
Refine Tasking Task.17 #2Tasking bv files that have changed STARGATE (Endpoint data characterisation)
Experiment Tasking Task.18 Tasking by geo value - google earth. public ip profiles. STARGATE (Endpoint data characterisation)
machine identifiers. Evolved MUTANT BROTH
Experiment Tasking Task.19 Tasking by type media content collection - IMIemail text, STARGATE (Endpoint data characterisation)
voice, video, eg "get me alli voice files" Automated taskinq
Refine Tasking Task.20 Tasking by user I author STAR GATE (Endpoint data characterisation)
Refine Tasking Task.22 keylog requests - useful for passwords and the like STARGATE (key log viewer)
Refine Tasking Task.26 reguest pings on IP addresses to determine eguipment STARGATE (Manual authorisation tool)
WDES- HIGH NOTE (CNE TD tools)
MUGSHOT
Experiment Tasking Task.28 Retrieve files based on text content- eg if the document has ROCK OPERA remote indexing
TOP SECRET in it, collect it, don't wait to be asked STARGATE (Shopping basket full functionality)
Experiment Tasking Task.29 §Eﬁ§éﬁg35bs STAR GATE (Screenshot viewer)
STARGATE (Shopping basket full functionality)
Refine Tasking Task.30 Tasking pre-Ehd Point (gueuing up tasking before the STARGATE (Manual authorisation tool)
endpoint is ready)
Experiment Tasking Task.33 Bulk tasking - ability to apply tasking parameters to the STARGATE (Manual authorisation tool)
networkI project; task a target SGT TURBINE (mission applications)
ACNO mission management
Experiment Tasking Task.34 Effects based tasking, for certain users e.g. ability to change STARGATE (Manual authorisation tool)
registry. watermark ﬁles. or even destroy the box? New CNE Effects too|
Experiment Tasking Task.36 Task an End Point to send tipping to the EREPO system for STARGATE (Manual authorisation tool)
collection on the active IP of the box. Put a beacon on this STARGATE (A|er[inq Components)
Refine Viewer View.01 mlrﬁﬂlﬁ configure every function of the viewer, so that STARGATE (Collaboration components)
settings are saveable and shareable LOOKING GLASS
Experiment Viewer View.02 ability to view content in foreign script (in the correct order) STARGATE ROADMAP iteration 8
UDAQZ
Experiment Viewer View.03 Across networks we need to be able to distinguish between: STARGATE (Network visualisation)
