(U) National Security Agency/Central Security Service (N SA/CSS): Classiﬁcation Guide Number: 2-400

(U//FOUO) Project/Activity Name: STELLARWIND (STLW)

(U) Ofﬁce of Origin: NSA/CSS Signals Intelligence Directorate (SID)

(U//FOUO) POC: William J. Amass, CT Special Projects

(U) Phone: 963-0087/963-0491(s)

(U//FOUO) Classiﬁed By: Keith B. Alexander, Lieutenant General, United States Army, Director, National Security Agency.
(U) Declassify On: 25 Years*

(U//FOUO) Note: This guide provides classiﬁcation guidance for information requiring marking and handling under the STELLARWIND special
compartment.

(TS//Sl//NF) In January 2008, the Director of National Intelligence authorized certain information associated with STELLARWIND, as well as
related information authorized under Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) orders (such as the Large Content Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act (FISA) orders, Business Records (BR) FISA orders and the Pen Register Trap and Trace (PR/TT) F ISA orders), to be removed from
the STELLARWIND compartment. This guide addresses information associated with STELLARWIND and associated classiﬁcation instructions,
while classiﬁcation guidance associated with FISA information can be found, in one location, in an NSA/CSS FISA/Protect America Act

(PAA)/F ISA Amendments Act (FAA) classiﬁcation guide authored by NSA SID Oversight and Compliance (SV). Consequently, this document will
reference an NSA/CSS F ISA/PAA/F AA classiﬁcation guidance where information formerly associated with STELLARWIND is now authorized by
the F ISC. Also, this document references classiﬁcation guidelines for FISA/PAA/F AA information and within Exceptionally Controlled Information
(ECI) compartments within NSA where necessary. Users should reference both guides to determine proper classiﬁcation. Additional Annexes are
provided as additional information to assist the users of this guide.

(TS//SI//NF) The markings “TSP” and “Compartmented” were at times used in brieﬁng materials and documentation associated with the
STELLARWIND program. “TSP” and “Compartmented” were used primarily by the National Security Agency (N SA) Legislative Affairs Ofﬁce
(LAO), NSA Ofﬁce of General Counsel (OGC), and the Executive Branch in brieﬁngs and declarations intended for external audiences, such as
Congress and the courts. The term “TSP” was initially used in relation to only that portion of the Program that was publicly disclosed by the
