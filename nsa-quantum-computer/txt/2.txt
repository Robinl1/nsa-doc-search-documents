(U) The CCP expects this Project to accomplish the following in FY
2013:

{---}

- (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Demonstrate dynamical decoupling
and complete quantum control on two semiconductor qubits. A
qubit is the basic “building block” of a quantum computer. This
will enable initial scaling towards large systems in related and
follow-on efforts. [CCP_0127]

(U) RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
(U) OWNING THE NET

(U) Project Description

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) The Owning the Net (OTN) Project
provides the technological means for NSA/CSS to gain access to and
securely return high value target communications. By concentrating on
the means of communication, the network itself, and network links
rather than end systems, OTN research manipulates equipment
hardware and software to control an adversary's network. Research is
conducted at the Laboratory for Telecommunications Sciences in
College Park, MD, and supports the evolving NSA/CSS internal
information infrastructure and the larger IC.
