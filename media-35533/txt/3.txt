LONG HAUL - Wikilnfo

keys, information about what crypt processing is appropriate, data needed for cryptanalytic
attacks, as well as information retained to enable future cryptanalytic attacks. LONGHAUL does
not store cipher data or ever have access to decrypted data. If the "technical data" passed to
Attack Service components or CES databases contains information from the collected stream (as
opposed to information about the collected stream such as SICAD, DTOI), then appropriate
Critical Identifying Information (CII) will be passed also. From a compliance perspective this is
the system being "certiﬁed".

(TS/ISI/IREL) Field deployed collection systems and CA Servers (also known as Extended
LONGHAUL) are shown on the left. A CA Server is the ﬁeld CES component that runs CA
Services. The terms CA Server or CA Services are used depending on the context
(hardware/software). For information on CA Server deployments see the CES/DNCA wiki pages
CA Servers (— , and for information on CA Server
architecture see LONGHAUL/CA Server. The CA Server stores cipher data, and decrypts it based
upon a key returned by LONGHAUL.

(S/lSI/IREL) LONGHAUL is a High Availability system using hardware at two geographically
distributed locations to also provide a COOP capability. LONGHAUL uses the Application
Messaging Framework AMF with the ISLANDTRANSPORT (ITX) transport and
ISLANDHIDEAWAY (IH) integrity and privacy capabilities to send data between collection
systems and LONGHAUL. The requestor of CA Services (the ﬁeld deployed CA Server) never
knows (or needs to know) which hardware is used to process its requests. LONGHAUL and the
AMF manage the physical routing and failover behavior of the system.

(TS/ISI/IREL) LONGHAUL has a Service-Oriented, Java-Based Enterprise Architecture. It includes
multiple coordinated software development efforts. Each Attack Orchestrator is a major
development effort, as are the Management and Analysis and Security and Policy
components. LONGHAUL also has a hardware acquisition component, and manages the
interfaces and integration activities with TURMOIL/TURBULENCE (collection), and the High
Performance Computing (HPC) activities of CES/T5. The LONGHAUL team is responsible for all
phases of development, starting with requirements, thorough design, technology selection,
development, integration, system test, and deployment. The team is also responsible for the
system engineering and hardware design and acquisition to support a two-site, high-availability
system.

(Cl/SI/IREL) In July 2010, T1, T5 and CES signed an SLA _,'~ for "the provisioning and support of
Cryptanalytic (CA) Services within the TURBULENCE Passive Collection Suite (TU PCS)."

(TS/ISI/IREL) POISONNUT (—) is a Child LONGHAUL
Project that enables Data Network Cipher (DNC) Recovery. Initial Customer Capability was
released on September 30, 2009. LONCHAUL/POISONNUT (DNC) was determined by CES and
T5 SPO to be IOC on 10 Jan. 2011.

(TS/ISI/IREL) SCARLETFEVER (_ is a Child

LONGHAUL Project that enables Data Network Session Cipher (DNSC) Recovery. Initial
Customer Capability was achieved in December 2010.

(U) Management and Analysis

(U) For this very high level view our diagram shows Management and Analysis as one block.
This block contains many components and further details can be found on the Software
Architecture page.
