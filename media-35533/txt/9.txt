(U) Tier 1 Support

(U) GECC - provides Tier 1 First Response/Help Desk support. The GECC attempt to resolve
unexpected operational issues using well-deﬁned procedures. If resolved by the GECC, then the
details of the resolution are recorded and no further action is required. If the incident cannot be
resolved using the remote capabilities at the Operations Center's disposal or within the
pre—determined time threshold, the incident is escalated to Tier 2 for resolution.

GECC to use WebSA to restart failing processes on COALCAR.

(U) Tier 2 Support

(Ul/FOUO) Tier 2 Support is provided by Maintenance/Operations Support (LONGHAUL team).
Maintenance/Operations Support provides the day-to—day administration and support of
production systems in accordance with documented, deployed conﬁgurations. Doing so usually
requires speciﬁc knowledge about the associated servers, applications and how they interact.
With respect to applications, this is referred to as "applications administration", as opposed to
"systems administrationll which is performed at the server hardware and operation systems (OS)
level. Tier 2 also serves as the escalation point for problems not resolved at the Tier 1 level.
Problems related to the internal workings of the software or are integration-related issues are
escalated to the appropriate Tier 3 organization for resolution. Use the "Tier 2 Support" link
