(U/IFOUO) LONGHAUL is composed of almost identical hardware at two geographically
distributed sites - the Tordella Supercomputer Building (TSCB) at Fort Meade and Oak Ridge
Data Center (ORDC) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The initial hardware conﬁgurations for TSCB and
ORDC arrived in November 2009 and May 2010 respectively. The ﬁnal conﬁgurations arrived in
Jan 2011 at both sites. A system, termed "Hadoop ClusterII has also been purchased to produce
