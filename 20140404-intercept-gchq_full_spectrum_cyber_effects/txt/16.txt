Vulnerability Assessment Process Development

to be done to achieve the outcome. Target Templating
protrudes that lrarnework in order to break down a problem

Layer 1: Target — an Entity such as a
person or organisation.

Layer 2: lnlrastructure - How the target
connects to the global network

Layer 3: Technology - Understanding the
technology the target uses to eemmumte

Layer 4: Vulnerahllltlea — Looking ‘lar

Layer 5: Capabilities - Can we explort the
vulnerabilities?

Layer 3: Access - What assets do we have
to collect the Hattie?

Layer 7: Expectation. Planning. Delivery -
Haw are we gomg to achieve the

deﬁll'od outcome?
