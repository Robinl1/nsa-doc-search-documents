0 Working definition: Active implant copies traffic and
directs a copy past a passive collector

— Issues arise when collector is also processing passive traffic
simultaneously

° Current: Implants on network infrastructure devices,
not user endpoints

0 Two types:
— Physical/link layer:

° an implant copies and shapes an entire link (E1, STMl) without
selection; passive midpoint does selection

— Network layer:

° an implant performs targeted copying based on IP or
application parameters and exfils only the targeted traffic;
passive collector may or may not do further selection.
