° IPSEC VPN:

— First packets between the devices establish the parameters
and encryption keys (IKE)

— Following this setup, “content” packets are encrypted and
transmitted packet by packet (ESP)

— CES wants the IKE exchange and maybe the ESP (content)

° TURMOIL passive capability:
— Passive capability to detect IKE and ESP
— Metadata record produced for every IKE exchange
— IKE for targeted VPN fonNarded directly to CES database

— For targeted VPN, real-time decryption is performed IF CES
can provide a key in time

— Decrypted IP traffic is processed by TURMOIL apps for
normal selection (VoIP, webmail, etc, etc)
