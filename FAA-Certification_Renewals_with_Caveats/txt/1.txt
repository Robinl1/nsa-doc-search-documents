('TSHSIHNF) The FISA Ccurt signed the 2C! 11 FAA Cernﬁcaticns cn 3 Oct Zﬂll — these
are valid until 2 Dct 21312, permitting SSE! FAA—autlrcrized accesses tc ccnﬁrrue
cperaticns. chever, in the Ell-page cpinicn, the judge crdered certain “upstream“ cr
“passive” FAA DNI cclleeticn tc cease after 3t] days? unless NSA implements scluticns
tc ccrrect all deﬁciencies identiﬁed in the cpinicn dccrrrnent. PRISM cperaticns are rrct
affected by these caveats. All PRISM pr‘cvidersp except Yahcc and Gccgle, were
successfully hairsiticned tc the new Certiﬁcations. We expect Yahcc and Gccgle tc
ccrnplete trairsiticning by Friday a Dct- Regarding the ncnuPRISl'rl FAA ccllecticn
prcgrarns, the Ccrut cited targeting and nrinirrriaaticn prccedures related tc ccllecticn cf
Multiple Ccrnruunicaticns Transacticns as “deﬁcient crr statutcry and ccmtituticnal
grcurrds.” SSD, Technclcg}.r Direetcrate, DEC? and cther crgairiaaticns are cccr‘dinating a
r'espcnse, which includes planning tc implement a ccnservative scluticn in which the
higher-nsk ccllectircn will be sequestered. It is possible that this higher risk ccllectinn
ccntains rrruch cf the ncn-duplicatirre FAA ccllecticn resulting in FAA repcrting frcrn
upstream accesses. This scluticn is designed tc ccnrply with the judge‘s cr'der'; hcwerrer,
the judge will have tc determine if it dces- If the sclrrticn is installed, SSE) will then wcr'k
with ICIIF'Is and DIG-C tc rncdiﬁy the scluticn cater time such that the ﬁltering pr'ccess will
be cptimiaed tc permit mcre T.ralid ccllecticn tc he prccessed and fcrwarded tn OFls.
Finally, in parallel with these etfcrts, the DGC is ccntemplating ﬁling an appeal tn the
ruling.
