DTl Accomplishments Supporting NCTC Goal 1: Leadership

(SUNF) One Millionth TIDE Person Record: On 28 June 2013, the Terrorist Identities
Datainart Enviromnent (TIDE) passed a milestone ofone million persons in 'l‘lDE. While
NC'I'C's Directorate ofTerrorist identities [DTI] seeks to create only as many person
records as are necessary for our nation’s counterterrorism mission, this number is a
testament to D'l‘l's hard work and dedication over the past 2.5 years. Since DTI stood up as
an independent NCTC Directorate in December 2010, analysts have created more than

43 0,000 terrorism-related person records and deleted 50,000 subjects whose nexus to
terrorism was refuted or did not meet current watchlisting criteria. In addition, DTI has
added over 730.000 biometric files to TIDE. On a daily basis, DTl analysts process more
than 250 nomination cables and 200 encounter reports, visa applications and other data
sources to support the US. Government's (USU) screening and terrorism analysis missions.

(S/jNF] Kingfisher Expanding its Role: NCTC deployed the Kingfisher Expansion (KFE)
visa support program on 15 June, 2013. KFE is a recently developed terrorist screening tool
that correlates large datasets to help enhance existing terrorist identity information to
support USG watchlisting‘jscreening missions. The KFE tool reviews DoS visa applications
for connections to terrorism information and then uses the knowledge to enhance existing
records maintained in TIDE. KFE performs a near real-time check againstTlDE for all
worldwide visa applicants prior to Department ufState [DOS] approval. KFE is processing
nearly 40,000 applicants each day, has processed over 4.6 million visas since its "go-live"
date in June, and is projected to save the DOS Wer $50 million in security check fees.
