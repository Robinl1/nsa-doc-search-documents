[S//NF] Reduction of TIDE Enhancement Backlog: This year, automation, policy
modifications, and resource realignments helped reduce a historic backlog of Department
ofState Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) records consisting of visa information on
KSTs that are already in TIDE and/or watchlisted in the TSDB. DTI had experienced a
historical backlog that numbered in excess of 153,000 records. This number was reduced
by 88% in FY13 to around 18,000 and that should be completely eliminated by Q1 2014.
This reduction will allow for all newly identified KST TIDE records to be enhanced with
CCD information within 48 hours of nomination.

[S//NF] NCTC Meets HSPD-24 Requirements for Biometric Export: In March 2013, in
accordance with HSPD—24/NSPD-59, the full implementation ofthe biometric export
occurred. This culminates a five year effort, which included significant changes such as
moving from TIDE1 to TIDEZ, in order to provide storing and matching capabilities for
facial images, fingerprints and iris scans. As part of this effort, NCTC delivered biometric
data for more than 127,000 known or suspected terrorists [KSTs) to the Terrorist
Screening Center to date. Due to the hard work by NCTC, writ large, these KSTs will have
their biometric data properly placed into the biometric Screening systems. This means
when one of these known or suspected terrorists attempts to enter the United States either
by applying for a visa or through a DIIS point ofentry screening, regardless of falsified
documentation, the subject will likely be denied entry.

[SUNF] Growth for Non-Traditional Biometric Data: DTI has continued to enhance
several "non-traditional" biometric data fields in TIDE, for FY13 TIDE has shown the
following growth: Handwriting (32%); Signatures (52%},- Scars/marks/tattoos [70%];
DNA strands [90%). Beginning collection on this data helps to ensure that when the
biometric and forensic community is ready to actively screen this data, that NCTC will be
readily ahle to provide the appropriate data on all known or suspected terrorists.
