[U/[FOUO] TIDE Quality Assurance Reviews: The Quality Assurance Branch [QAB)
reviewed 6,500 legacy records as part ofa proactive scrub of 60,000 single-source TIDE
records where no update has occurred since January 2011. QAB reviewed records for
2,550 KSTs from visa waiver countries and 3,800 of the qualifying records that were
created between 1994- and 1996. This work resulted in: 61 individuals removed from
watchlisting {including 30 deletions from TIDE),- three upgrades to TSA NOFLY; nine
records merged with other entries; and 39 records with added biographic data. Additional
enhancement work by the Identity Enhancement Team on 500 ofthe visa waiver records
resulted in 10 watchlisting Upgrades, and the addition of 47 first—time dates ofbirth, and 14
biometric files.
