and their impact on EU citizens’
fundamental rights

NOTE

 

Abstract

In light of the recent PRISM-related revelations, this briefing note analyzes
the impact of US surveillance programmes on European citizens’ rights. The
note explores the scope of surveillance that can be carried out under the US
FISA Amendments Act 2008, and related practices of the US authorities
which have very strong implications for EU data sovereignty and the
protection of European citizens’ rights.
