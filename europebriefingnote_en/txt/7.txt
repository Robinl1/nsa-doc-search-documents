The US surveillance programmes and their impact on EU citizens' fundamental rights

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This Briefing note provides the LIBE Committee with background and contextual
information on PRISM/FlSA/NSA activities and US surveillance programmes, and their
specific impact on EU citizens’ fundamental rights, including privacy and data protection.

Prior to the PRISM scandal, European media underestimated this aspect, apparently
oblivious to the fact that the surveillance activity was primarily directed at the rest-of-the-
world, and was not targeted at US citizens. The note argues that the scope of surveillance
under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008 (FAA) has
very strong implications on EU data sovereignty and the protection of its citizens’ rights.

The first section provides a historical account of US surveillance programmes,
showing that the US authorities have continuously disregarded the human right to privacy
of non-Americans. The analysis of various surveillance programmes (Echelon, PRISM) and
US national security legislation (FISA, PATRIOT and FAA) clearly indicates that surveillance
activities by the US authorities are conducted without taking into account the rights of non-
US citizens and residents. In particular, the scope of FAA creates a power of mass-
surveillance specifically targeted at the data of non-US persons located outside the US,
including data processed by ’Cloud computing’, which eludes EU Data Protection regulation.

The second section gives an overview of the main legal gaps, loopholes and
controversies of these programmes and their differing consequences for the
rights of American and EU citizens. The section unravels the legal provisions governing
US surveillance programmes and further uncertainties in their application, such as:

- serious limitations to the Fourth Amendment for US citizens
- specific powers over communications and personal data of “non-US persons”

- absence of any cognizable privacy rights for “non-US persons” under Fl SA

The section also shows that the accelerating and already widespread use of Cloud
computing further undermines data protection for EU citizens, and that a review of some of
the existing and proposed mechanisms that have been put in place to protect EU citizens’
rights after data export, actually function as loopholes.

Finally, some strategic options for the European Parliament are developed, and
related recommendations are suggested in order to improve future EU regulation and to
provide effective safeguards for protection for EU citizens’ rights.
