(TS#SI#NF) (9G0 Attorney): To get started, let’s discuss the individual Bulk Metadata Programs. The BR Program pertains to the acquisition of telephony
metadata. The associated FISC Grder allows NSA to ask specific U.S.-based telecommunications service providers for their business records. The
business records, also known as call detail records, contain information about phone calls.
