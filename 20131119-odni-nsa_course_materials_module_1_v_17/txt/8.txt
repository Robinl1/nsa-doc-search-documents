(W) (OGC Attorney): NSA must reapply to the FISC every 90 days to continue operating under these authorities. This process allows forthe
Government to seek modiﬁcations and for the FISC to update these authorities to reﬂect changes that may affect NSA‘s collection and handling of BR and
PRrTT bulk metadata. It is also crucial that all factors associated with NSA's implementation of these programs are fully compliant with the FISC Orders

and guidelines.

(ISllSIIINE) As new orders are issued, this training may be augmented to address significant changes. Your organization will notify you if or when
additional training is necessary. Should you have questions, you are strongly encouraged to contact your manager, Cou nterterrorism (CT) Homeland
Security Analysis Center (HSAC), Technology Directorate (TD) Compliance, SID Oversight and Compliance, or the Office of General Counsel (OGC) for

assistance and guidance.
