(IS#SI#NF) (OGC Attorney): There are two high level differences between the Orders as well. Details of the differences will be addressed in later modules,
but at a basic level, the biggest difference between the two Programs is how the metadata is obtainedr

  

(ISL/SIM) The other point where the Bulk Metadata Programs differ is in the area of hop restrictions for contact chaining. This will be described in detail
in Module 4, but for now it is important to know that according to the Orders the hop restrictions are different forthe BR and PR/TT Programs.
