Scenario: -@yahoo

@yahoo.com emergency detasked from DS-ZOOB and
US—31 71 at 13:04Z on 20 Oct

Numerous first-order address books and inboxes collected
meant tasked selectors on address books or buddy lists of
contacts of @yahoo.com also affected:

— @yahoo.com and _@gmail.com emergency
detasked off US-3171 at 13:1 OZ on 20 Sep

Memorializing to PINWALE only address books and inboxes
owned by target selectors would have reduced PINWALE
volumes 90°/o+

— Site XKEYSCOREs would buffer data for SIGDEV purposes

— Metadata from known owner address books and inboxes stored regardless
