Yahoo Webmessenger

 

Update data sent to individuals logged into Yahoo’s Instant
Messenger service online

— Online contact status, unread emails in Yahoo inbox

— Usually small sessions (2—4kB)

Sporadic collection (30,000 — 60,000 sessions per day)

Intermittent bursts of collection against contacts of targets
— Large numbers of sessions (20,000+) against a single targeted selector
— Not collected against the target (online presence/unread email from target)
— No owner attribution (metadata value limited to fact-of comms for emails,
online presence events for buddies)
Over a dozen selectors detasked in two weeks
— Because a target’s contact was using/idling on Yahoo Webmessenger
— Several very timely selectors (Libyan transition, Greek financial related)
