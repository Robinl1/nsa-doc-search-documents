concerns about the lawfulness of the Authorization but worried about the
politics. After some hesitancy, the White House gave General Hayden
permission to brief certain members of Congress. in addition, the Chief
Judge of the FISC was ﬁrst cleared in January 2002 (see Section ).

(TSI/Sl/INF) Interactions with Members of Congress. Between 25
October 2001 and 17 January 2007, General Hayden, sometimes supported
by operational target experts from the CT Product Line and $80 ofﬁce,
conducted over 49 brieﬁngs to members of Congress or their staff. (See
Appedix __ for a complete list of brieﬁngs.)

(TS/ISI/fNF) General Hayden ﬁrst briefed the following members of
Congress on 25 October 2001:

Chair - House Permanent Select Cemmittee on intelligence

Ranking Minority Member of the House Permanent Select
Committee on Intelligence

(TSI/SI/INF) In addition, NSA received and responded to a variety of
Program-related inquiries from members of Congress, including Senators
Inouye, Stevens, Pelosi, and Rockefeller.

(U/fFOUO ) General Hayden always believed that the PSP was legal. He
said that during the many PSPwrelated brieﬁngs he gave to members of
Congress, no one ever said that NSA should stop what it was doing. He
emphasized that he did not just "ﬂip through slides" during the brieﬁngs.
They lasted as long as attendees desired.

(TS/fSI/INF) Interactions with the FISC. On 31 January 2002, Chief
Judge Royce Lamberth was briefed on the PSP and on 17 May 2002, his

successor, Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, was briefed. A law clerk was also
briefed in April 2004. (See Section Five.)

(TS/KSI-ECI/INF) NSA managed the NSA clearance process. Clearance
requests were submitted to the PSP Program Office for Program Manager
