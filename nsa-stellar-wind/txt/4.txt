(U) This Report

(UJ/FOUO) On 4 October 2001, President George W. Bush issued a
memorandum entitled “AUTHORIZATION FOR SPECIFIED
ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE ACTIVITIES DURING A LIMITED
PERIOD TO DETECT AND PREVENT ACTS OF TERRORISM
WITHIN THE UNITED STATES.” The memorandum was based on the
President’s determination that aﬁer the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks
in the United States, an extraordinary emergency existed for national
defense purposes.

(TS/ISI/J’ORJNF) The 4 October 2001 Presidential authorization delegated
authority to the Secretary of Defense, who further delegated it to the
Director of National Securitv A 'cnc (Chief. Central Securitv Service
ENSNQL-ICSSJ to conduct speciﬁed electmnic surveillance on targets
related to Afghanistan and international terrorism for 30 days. Because the
surveillance included wire and cable communications carried into or out of
the United States, it would otherwise have required FISC authority.

   

(TS/fSlf/OR/NF) The Authorization speciﬁed that NSA could acquire the
content and associated metadata of telephony and Internet communications
for which there was probable cause to believe that one of the
communicants was in Afghanistan or that one communicant was engaged
in or preparing for acts of international terroriSm. In addition, NSA was
authorized to acquire telephony and lntemet metadata1 for communicatious
with at least one communicant outside the United States or for which no

the communications acquired under the authority. 3
