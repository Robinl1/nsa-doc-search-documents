would grant a warrant before initiating emergency surveillance.
Additionally, before NSA surveillance requests were submitted to the
Attorney General, they had to be reviewed by NSA intelligence omelet-3,
NSA attorneys, and Department of Justice attorneys. Each reviewer had to
be satisﬁed that standards had been met before the request proceeded to the
next review group, and each request was certiﬁed by a senior oﬁicial in the

(Ul/FOUO) Early Efforts to Amend FISA

(TS/fSiI/NF) Given the limitations of FlSA, there were early
efforts to amend the statute. For example, shortly after 11

amend FlSA were abandoned. Anecdotal evidence

personnel, he described to the White House how NSA collection of
communications on a wire inside the United States was constrained by the
