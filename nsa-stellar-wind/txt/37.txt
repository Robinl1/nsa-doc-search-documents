engineering). Records included all call events from the companies’ long
distance and international communication networks. The Call Detail
Records were aggregated as large files by TS/SCI—eleared groups at
COMPANY A and COMPANY B and forwarded, on an hourly or daily
basis, across classiﬁed communications circuits to a PSPFrestricted NSA
data repository.

COMPANY A provided PSP-authorized CDRs as early as November 2001,
and COMPANY B began to provide CDRs in February 2002. Both
continued to provide this support through the end of the PSP, and support

2003.

assistance was access to Internet Protocol (11") metadata associated with
communications of al Qaeda (and affiliates) from data links owned or
operated by COMPANIES A, B, and C. in order to be a candidate for PSP
IP metadata collection, data links were first vetted to ensure that the
preponderance of communications was from foreign sources, and that there
was a high probability of collecting al Qaeda (and afﬁliate)
communications. NSA took great care to ensure that metadata was
produced against foreign, not domestic, communications.

(TSf/SI-Ele/NF) COMPANY A began providing PSP IP metadata
collection as early as November 2001. Although COMPANY B began
providing CD—ROMs of PSP IP metadata in October 2001, an automated
transfer of data was not available until February-March 2002. The
Presidential authority to collect IP metadata was terminated in March 2004.
COMPANY A and COMPANY B [P metadata collection resumed after the
FISC Pen Register/T rap dc Trace (PRJTT) Order authorizing this activity
was signed on 15 July 2004. COMPANY C provided 1P metadata
beginning in April 2005.
