WORKING DRAFT

 

(U) NSA [6 Nat Cleared until 2002

(TSIXSl/WF) We could not determine exact reasons for
why the NSA lG was not cleared for the PSP until
August 2002. According to the NSA General Counsel,
the President would not allow the it? to be briefed
sooner. General Hayden did not speciﬁcally reball why
the lG was not brought in earlier; but thought that it
had not been appropriate to do so when it was
uncertain how long the Program would last and before
operations had stabilized. The NBA lG pointed out
that he did not take the K3 position until April 2002, so
NSA leadership or the White House may have been
resistant to clearing either a new or an acting lG.

(TS/r’Sl/lNF) Regardless, by August 2002, General
Hayden and the NSA General Counsel wanted to
institutionalize oversight of the Program by bringing in
the i6. General Hayden recalled ha wing to “make a
case" to the White House to clear the lG at that time.

 

 

(U/r’FOUO) OlG concerns lead to change

(C) In addition to formal recommendations made in review and
investigative reports, OIG cancer-as about access to the terms of the
Presidential authorization and about the means of reporting PSP violations
resulted in three major changes.

(C) First, in December 2002, the [G recommended that General Hayden
formally delegate authority to NBA operational personnel, some of whom
had unknowingly violated terms of the Authorization. The Counsel to the
Vice President, demanding secrecy, refused to let them see terms of the
authority, which had been delegated by the President to the Secretary of
Defense, who delegated it to the Director of NSA. General Hayden issued
the ﬁrst “Delegation of Authority” letter to key operational personnel in the
SID on 4 March 2003. Subsequent delegation letters were issued each time
the President renewed the authority.
