domestic selectors. Consequently, on 10 January 2007, the FISC signed
two separate orders: the Foreign Content Order and the Domestic Content
Order.

(TS/{Sl/fNF) The Foreign Content Order negatively aﬁ‘ected SIGINT
exploitation. Most notably, the number of foreign selectors on collection
dmpped by 73 percent, from 11,000 selectors under PSP to 3,000 under the
order. In addition, the administrative workload for NBA analysts to put
critical foreign selectors 0n collection was so burdensome that the order
became operationally unsustainable. The order was eventually superseded
by Congress’ FISA modernization. It was temporarily replaced by the
Protect America Act in August 2007 and then permanently replaced by the
FISA Amendments Act in July 2008.

(TS/fSl/INF) The Domestic Content Order did not create a similar loss in
collection because so few domestic numbers were tasked at that time. It
did, however, slow operations because of the documentation required, and
it took considerably longer to task under the order than under the PSP.
Over time, the scope of the Domestic Content Order gradually decreased to
a single selector tasked for collection in January 2009. In January 2009,
the FBI, at NSA’s request, assumed responsibility for the Domestic Content
Order and became the declarant before the FISC.
