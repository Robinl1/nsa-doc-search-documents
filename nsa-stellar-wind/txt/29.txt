to perform assigned job duties. The Program Manager questioned access
requests with unclearjustiﬁcations. Approved requests were forwarded to
the Program security officer, who performed a security check. If the
security check yielded nothing to impede access, individuals were
instructed to go to the security oﬁ’ice to read the “Security Pro—Brief
Agreement” and sign a “Sensitive Compartmented lnformaticm
Nondisclosure Agreement” form. NSA’s General Counsel also had the
authority to read in Attorneys from other agencies.

(TS/ISl/IN F) On 20 May 2005, the Program Manager changed the PSP
clearance request and re-certiﬁcation process. The Project Security Ofﬁcer
assigned to Special Source Operations in the SIGINT Directorate assumed
responsibility for the PSP clearance process. (Special Source Operations
managed all PSP-related collection for NSA.) Additionally, the Program
Manager initiated monthly PSP clearance brieﬁngs.

(TS/fSI/INF) From 4 October 2001 until 23 May 2005, a two-level PSP
clearance structure was used. One level was limited to the “fact of“
Program existence. A second level included access to PSP targeting data
through a “must know” principle. Access lists were maintained in the 880
Security Director’s oﬁice on an internal SSO compartmented LAN.

(TSI/SI-ECI/INF) Regular zero-based reviews were conducted by the 880
Security Director’s office quarteriy to validate that cleared individuals had
a continuing need for access to PSP information. The clearance did not
automatically transfer with individuals who moved to new assignments.
The clearance had to be re—justiﬁed for the new position, or the individual
would be debriefed from the Program.
