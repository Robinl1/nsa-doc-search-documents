(TSI/SIIINF) Transition of Internet Metadata Collection to Pen Register/T rap
and Trace Order Authority

(TS/ISIJfNF) According to NSA personnel, the decision to transition
Internet metadata collection to a FISC order was driven by Del. At a
meeting on 26 March 2007, DoJ directed NSA representatives from OGC
and SID to ﬁnd a legal basis, using a FISC order, to recreate NSA’s PSP
antherity to collect bulk Internet metadata.

(TS/JSI/INF) After extensive coordination, D01 and NSA devised the
PRJTT theory to which the Chief Judge of the FISC seemed amenable.
DoJ and NSA worked closely over the following months, exchanging
drafts of the application, preparing declarations, and reaponding to
questions from court advisers. NSA representatives explained the
Capabilities that were needed to recreate the Authority, and Del personnel
devised a workable legal basis to meet those needs. In April 2004, NSA
briefed Judge Kollar—Kotelly and a law clerk because Judge Kollar—Kotelly
was researching the impact of using PSP-derived information in FISA
applications. In May 2004, NSA personnel provided a technical briefing
on NSA collection of bulk Internet metadata to Judge Kollar-Kotelly. In
addition, General Hayden said he met with Judge Kollar—Kotelly on two
Successive Saturdays during the summer of 2004 to discuss the on-going
eﬁons.

(TS/J’SIIINF) The F lSC signed the first PRfIT order on 14 July 2004.
Although NSA lost access to the bulk metadata from 26 March 2004 until
the order was signed, the order essentially gave NSA the same authority to
collect bulk Internet metadata that it had under the PSP, except that it
speciﬁed the datalinks from which NSA could collect, and it limited the
number of people that could access the data. The FISC continues to renew
the PR/TT approximately every 90 days.

(T S/lSl/INF) Transition of Telephony Metadata Collection to the Business
Records Order

(TSI/SI/INF) According to NBA General Counsel Vito Potenza, the
decision to transition telephony metadata to the Business Records Order
was driven by a private sector company. After the New York Times article
was published in December 2005, Mr. Potenza stated that one of the PSP
providers expressed concern about providing telephony metadata to NSA
under Presidential Authority without being compelled. Although OLC’s
