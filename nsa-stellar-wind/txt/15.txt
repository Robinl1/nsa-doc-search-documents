WORKING DRAFT

(U) Organizational Structure

(TS/ISIf/NF) NSA conducted all PSP analysis and reporting at its
headquarters at Ft. Meade, Maryland, within the SIGINT Directorate.
Speciﬁcally, tasking approvals, analysis, and reporting were conducted in
the CT Product Line within SID, Analysis and Production. Collection of
data was managed in SID, Directorate for Acquisition. No PSP activities
were managed at NSA ﬁeld sites.

 

(TS/ISI/INF) Although the formal chain of command for SIGINT
operations was through SID, in practice, the Director and Deputy Director
of NSA/CSS managed the Program while keeping the SIGINT Director
informed. Over time, the SIGINT Director became more involved, but the
Director and Deputy Director always maintained direct operational control.

(TSf/SWNF) Program Manager. Five ofﬁcials held the Program
Manager position over the life of the PSP.’ Initially, the Program Manager
reported to the Chief of the CT Product Line. In 2004, the Program
Manager position was restructured as the SID Program Managerfor CT
Special Projects and elevated to report to the SIGINT Director. This
allowed the Program Manager jurisdiction of PSP elements across SID, not
just those within the Directorate for Analysis and Production. At that time,
the position was also formally designated as a senior level civilian position.
A small staff was added to form the Program Management Ofﬁce.

(TS/ISIHNF) SID Analysis and Production. Initially, the MAC
analyzed PSP metadata (data that describes the content, events, or networks
associated with SIGINT targets), while SIGINT Development in the CT
Product Line analyzed non—P3P metadata. The CT Product Line performed
PSP content analysis. SIGINT Development, a separate organization
within the SID, managed approvals for content tasking. In 2004, the
analysis and production of metadata and content were consolidated into a
new organization called the Advanced Analysis Division (AAD). AAD
was divided into three teams: internet metadata, telephony metadata, and
content.

(TSﬂSlf/NF) Coordination with FBI and CIA. By 2004, four FBI

integrees and two CIA integrees, operating under SIGINT authorities in
accordance with written agreements, were co-located with NSA PSP~

5(TSI/Slt‘fNF) The Chief of the CT Product Line was Acting Program Manager for a brief time in 2004.
