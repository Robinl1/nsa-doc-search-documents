(U) Message from the NIARL Director:

(U/I’FOUO) Welcome to the September 2008 edition of the National
Information Assurance Research Laboratory (NIARL) newsletter. The
NIARL is designated as the R2 organization within the NSA Research
Directorate. NIARL/R2 is responsible for conducting and sponsoring
research in technologies and techniques needed to secure America‘s
future information systems. While breaking new ground is certainly
rewarding, the overall goal for this research and exploration is to
identify concepts and solutions to reduce the Information Assurance
(IA) risks facing our nation’s critical information systems.

 

(Ul/FOUO) Within R2’s general IA research thrusts of Crypto—Math, IA Engineering, and
Defensive Computing, there are specific “Focus Areas” dedicated to existing andfor
anticipated critical challenges and technical IA risks. Focus Areas encompass topics such as
Research Integration, High Confidence Software and Systems, Secure Wireless Multimedia,
and Security Enhanced Operatin Environments. For a complete listing of R2 Focus Areas
please refer to the R2 website at?

(Ul/FOUO) In this issue of The EDGE we examine the Research Integration Focus Area and
the associated IA research challenges of bringing research concepts together, providing
relevant mission context, and presenting IA approaches to customers and stakeholders. R223
leads the Research Integration Focus Area and is charged with shepherding IA concepts and
innovations into the research prototype and demonstration stage. Please see the article “T_he
Research Journey from Passion to Prototype” for a detailed discussion of this tapic.

 

(Ul/FOUO) I am sincere—1v interested in your feedback and suggestions, and I ask that you
email your comments to= R2 Office Manager, a_ We look
forward to hearing from y—I—ou!
