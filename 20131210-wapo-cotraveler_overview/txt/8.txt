Future Work

(TS//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY) The purpose of this service is to determine whether two entities could have
been co-located given observed event locations for those entities. To detect co-travel, the analyst would
need to define a series of meeting locations and times. The opportunity volume analytic could also
provide a mechanism for vetting co-travel analytics by testing for possible co-location events along co-
travel routes.

Background

(TS//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY) The E Track Mutual Information (TMI) cloud analytic
was developed as a study under their graph analytics, alerting, and target development program. The
analytic is oriented to work on 7 to 30 days worth of regional collection. It has been tested on RT-RG
data from the - region. Instead of using GCID information as co-travel reference points, the
analytic works cross-network by computing target ”closeness” based on the GCID Lat/Long GEO
information and time. The Lat/Long information is obtained from RT-RG.

(TS//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY) The analytic starts by computing event sequences of LAT, LONG, and time for
each selector. These are called ”tracks”. It then computes a value that measures how far the selector
has traveled in general. If the selector has not traveled outside a 20 to 50 km radius, the selector is not
considered. Each eligible selector’s tracks are pairwise-compared to the others and a measure of
similarity in time and space is computed.

Future Work

(TS//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY). would like to reduce processing by creating an index containing selectors
whose tracks are near each other in space. To achieve this, future work may make use of a GEOAddress
hashing algorithm that uses LAT/LONG information to group cell towers into clusters that are in the
same region. This hash considers latitude and longitude only, and is agnostic to the targets’ service
provider. It may be possible to also compare target tracks quickly by comparing these GeoAddresses.
