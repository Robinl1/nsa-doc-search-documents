RT-RG Sidekicks
—

Background

(TS//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY) The RT-RG Sidekick Cloud-Based Co-traveler analytic compares average travel
velocity between pairs of selectors to infer whether or not could co-travel would practically be possible.
The velocity factor is intended to reduce the number of false positives when considering travel among
urban areas by filtering out pairs of selectors that were seen at the same series of CELL IDs or VLRs over
time, but could not have been traveling together because the location data timestamps presuppose an
unreasonable velocity. This may happen because one or both of the selectors in the pair may have been
located at the edges of the network coverage during one or more of their travel midpoints.

(TS//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY) The analytic first computes ”movement summaries” of all available tasked
selectors. The movement summaries contain a list of locations that a target visited during the timeframe
of interest, given by the analyst. Locations are defined by CELL IDs (for GSM) or GEO-Hashes (for-
any other selectors with Lat/Long). Then, the system discovers pairs of targets that could be traveling
together by comparing their sequences of physical locations and factoring out pairs that could not have
reasonably arrived at the meeting waypoints within 10 minutes of each other.

(TS//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY) One of the main benefits of the RT-RG Sidekicks analytic is that it is not
constrained by provider network. Because it considers physical (LAT/LONG) locations and travel
velocities, it can provide co-traveler results that include selectors on different provider networks.

Status and Summary

Status Source Data Caveats

- QFD available at RT-RG analyst - Sortinglead Event Summaries - Requires accurate tower geo
desktop. _ﬂ data (location and date)
RT-RG Tools: Goldminer, CHET, of Fascia PCS) - Requires pre-computing all
GEOT - Currently running on RT—RG selectors against all selectors,

_ which can be expensive

- Could possibly scale to FASCIA - Current output includes only
event summaries tasked selectors
- Analytic is not designed for
stationary targets.

 

Future Work
(TS//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY) Currently, the system is integrated with RT-RG, operating on—
GSM data. It may scale to a larger data source; however, it is designed to precompute sidekicks for each

possible pair or tasked selectors.

(TS//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY) This analytic could also be applied to DNl location data.
