GATC Opportunity Volume Analytic and the- Meet&Greet Spatial Chaining Analytic.

CHALKFUN

Background

(TS//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY) Chalkfun’s Co-Travel analytic computes the date, time, and network location
of a mobile phone over a given time period, and then looks for other mobile phones that were seen in
the same network locations around a one hour time window. When a selector was seen at the same
location (e.g., VLR) during the time window, the algorithm will reduce processing time by choosing a few

events to match over the time period. Chalkfun is SPCMA enabledl.

(S//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY) Note: As of 6 September 2012, the events that are chosen depend on the
”sampling method” chosen by the analyst (most active, most per day, first/last/most, or
first/last/spread). The ”sampling rate” specifies how many events are chosen to match. As Chalkfun

moves to the cloud, this option will be discontinued.

(TS//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY) The cloud-based version of Chalkfun (see R6 SORTINGLEAD Co-traveler
Analytic section), which may be released as early as September 2012, will have a number of additional

features and options:

0 The system will run one query (rather than separate queries) for all of the lMSIs, MSISDNs, VLRs,
and GCIDs that an analyst enters (as if the selectors and areas of interest were joined with an
”OR”). The system currently runs separate queries for each, returning separate sets of results for
each combination of selector and areas of interest. The cloud-based version will also enable the
user to set the size of the time window that the analytic considers, rather than defaulting to one
hour (as described above).

0 The user will be able to choose the countries or locations of interest. Blacklist and whitelist
features will enable the user to instruct the system to ignore activity within a region, or restrict
analysis to specified regions of interest (e.g., ignore activity in: or use only activity from
-)

o In considering potential co-travelers, the analyst will have the option to ignore activity in which

the target is in his home country

 

1(S//S|//REL)SPCMA enables the analytic to chain "from," "through," or "to" communications metadata fields
without regard to the nationality or location of the communicants, and users may view those same
communications metadata fields in an unmasked form.
