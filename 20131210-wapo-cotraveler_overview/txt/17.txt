1. Start with a target selector (e.g. IMSI)
2. Query the target selector for PCS events to identify cell towers this target his hitting off of and
at what date/time.
3. Note the cell towers, location of the cell towers, and the date/times
4. Query those cell towers (and other cell towers in the area) for those dates and times to
identify other users who are hitting off of those towers
5. Compare the results of the users hitting off of the cell towers.
6. Rank the selectors as being possible candidates for co-travelers based on what cell towers
they hit on at the right times.
7. Selectors that are reliably seen to be hitting off of the same towers at the same times more
than others should get a higher rank.

Summary

(S//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY) At the beginning of this paper, we presented a number of key issues and
questions. Many of the analytics define themselves by (1) the key issues they address in novel ways and

(2) the types of source data on which they operate.

(S//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY) The key issues section highlights capabilities that might improve the accuracy
of the analytic results. For example, analytics that have knowledge about the locations of GCIDs and
VLRs and can augment their procedures with non-SIGINT data such as geographic and terrestrial data.
This information contains knowledge about the locations of highways and roads. Analytics that can
geographically validate routes between meeting points can then use this information to constrain the

possible co-travel routes and candidate co-travel selectors along those routes.

(S//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY) Analytics that can operate on a variety of different source data formats,
including both DNI and DNR, benefit from the ability to exploit divergent data sources to develop more

complete pictures of target travel behavior.

(S//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY) The co-travel analytics in this study are at various stages of development,
testing, and deployment. One possible way forward could be to have an independent organization2
perform a formal evaluation of these analytics using a common test dataset. This would enable a fair
comparison and assessment of the analyticsâ€™ processing time, efficiency, and accuracy. Understanding
the advantages and challenges of each analytic against a common test dataset with ground truth may
facilitate planning for future work.

 

2 An independent organization is one that is not involved in the development of any of these analytics and that
does not have a stake in the outcome.
