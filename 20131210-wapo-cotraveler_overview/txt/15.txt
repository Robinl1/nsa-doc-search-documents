with GEO reference data (or geo-tagging where available). Because this data provides city-level location
resolution, co-traveler candidates are assigned scores based on the extent to which they were seen in
the same cities and on the same days as targets.

(TS//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY) The second mode accepts a pattern representing target travel across
spanning countries of interest (e.g.,=), and optionally, the days on which the countries
were visited. In this mode, the TAC/Cafe/TMAC DNI Co-travel analytic in this mode identifies travelers
that (at minimum) match the pattern. All candidates that match the pattern are regarded as possible
co-travelers.

(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) The result of these analytics is a QFD monthly roll-up that can be queried.

Status and Summary

Status Source Data Caveats

Available to developers with - Tasked DNI selectors (U'IT) - Tasked targets or travel
access to Ghostmachine (GM- - Geotagged ASDF data patterns provided as input;
PLACE) - User-provided travel patterns results include tasked and

untasked targets

- Analytic operates at the
country level to determine
travel/city level for co-traveler
determination, and designed to
provide monthly QFD roll-up

- Proxies and other shared |P
settings can render |P
geolocation susceptible

 

Future Work

(S//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY) The TAC/Cafe/TMAC DNI Co-traveler team also considered capabilities to
enable follow-on queries utilizing CHALKFUN for convergence efforts to identify roaming handsets as
possible DNI target co-travelers.
