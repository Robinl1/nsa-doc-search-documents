RC5 9 - Reading sequences

0 events that trigger an action (i.e.: a call is received on the device)

0 actions run when an event occurs (i.e.: start recording the call)

0 sub-actions run when an event occurs (i.e.: hidden SMS sent with device position)

0 moduies which, enabled by an action, start collecting the desired evidence or trigger other

actions on the device (i.e.: record call audio)
0 sequences, used to indicate a group of events, actions, sub-actions and modules.

' NOTE: some events, action and module options are only available in advanced
conﬁguration.

Reading sequences
Complex sequences can be read as follows:

0 When the device is connected to the power source (event)...

0 ...send an SMS (sub-action) and...

0 ...start logging the position (action that triggers a module) and...

o ...disable the event occurring when the SIM is changed (action that disables an event)
0 ...and so on

Possible event, action, sub-action and module combinations are inﬁnite. Following is a detailed
explanation of correct design rules.

Events
Events are monitored by the agent and can start, repeat or end an action.

6 NOTE: a module cannot be directly started by an event.

For example, a Window event (window opened on the device) can trigger an action. The action
will then startfstop a module.

lv’arious types of events are available. For the full list see "Event iist" on page 112 .
The relation between an event and one or more actions is represented by a connector:

 

Reiotion between events Description Connector
and actions

Start Start an action when the event occurs. I
Repeat Repeat an action. The Interval and number of -

repetitions can be specified.

End Start an action when the event is over.
