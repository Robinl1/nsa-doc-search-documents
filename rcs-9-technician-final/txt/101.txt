RC5 9 - Synchronization wilh RC5 server

 

0 NOTE: the injection network can be external or an open WiFi network simulated by the
Tactical Control Center.

Synchronization with RCS server

Tactical Control Center synchronizes with RC5 to receive the updated infection rules and to check
whether a new version of Tactical Control Center is available and send logs.

Synchronization can occur in two ways:

. manually, the first time to receive injection rules.
1- automatically with an infection in progress.

Updating infection rules

If traffic generated by the target cannot be infected with the current rules, request operator
assistance on RC5 Console to generate new rules and update Network Injector. Receive the new
rules the next time Tactical Control Center is synchronized to view them.

Using network interfaces

Two different network interfaces are available during an attack, one for snifﬁng and one for
injection. Using two separate interfaces is indicated to guarantee continuity, especially for
sniffing.

Only the snifﬁng interface is used when emulating the Access Point and acquiring network
passwords.

Sniffing interfaces can be internal or external: external interfaces are indicated for sniffing
because transmission speed is higher.

Infection via automatic identification

The steps needed to infect devices automatically identified by RC5 rules are described below. The
attack can be run on wired or WiFi networks:

Phase Description Where

 

1 Prepare identification and injection rules for known targets RC5 Console, System,

2 Enable synchronization with RC5 to receive updated rules. TdctchI Network
