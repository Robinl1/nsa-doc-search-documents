Investigation Wizard

This wizard quickly creates an agent. The wizard asks you to enter the name (i.e.: "SmartSpy") and
type of agent to be created (desktop or mobile) and creates, in the following order:

1. a "Sm artSpy" operation

2. a "Sm artSpy" target

3 a "Sm artSpy" factory

4. a "Sm artSpy" user group in which the current user is the sole member

and directly opens the factory conﬁguration page. See "Basic factory or agent configuration" on
page 50

Other elements can be added to this operation, target or user group by simply using the detail
page.

Shared interface elements and actions

Each program page uses shared elements and allows similar actions to be run.

For easier manual comprehension, elements and actions shared by some functions are described
in this chapter.
