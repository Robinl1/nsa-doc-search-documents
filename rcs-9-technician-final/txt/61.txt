RC5 9 - Agent conﬁguration

 

0 NOTE: in case evidence is not received from an agent in demo mode, this may be due to a
server settings error or impossibility of reaching the address of the set Collector (i.e.: due
to network settings problems).

Agent configuration

Agent conﬁguration (basic or advanced) can be repeatedly edited. When saved, a copy of the
configuration is created and saved in the conﬁguration log.

At the next synchronization, the agent will receive the new configuration (.5th time) and
communicate successful installation (Activated). From that point on, any changes can only be
made by saving a new configuration.

6 NOTE: If .5th time and Activated are null, the current settings can still be edited.

For a description of agent configuration log data see "ﬁlgent conﬁguration log data" on page 43 .
