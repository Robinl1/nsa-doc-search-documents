RC5 9 - What happenswhen a rule is enabledldisabled

 

What happens when a rule is enabled/disabled

Enabling a rule means making it available to the Network Injector injection process. RC5 routinely
communicates with Network Injector to send rules and acquire logs. The operator is in charge of
enabling this synchronization for Tactical Network Injector.

A rule that is not enabled is not applicable meaning it cannot be sent to the Network Injector.

Starting the infection

After Network Injector receives the infection rules, it is ready to start an attack.

During the sniffing phase, it checks whether any of the devices in the network meets the
identiﬁcation rules. If so, it sends the agent to the identified device and infects it.
