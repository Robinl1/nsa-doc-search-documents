RC5 9 - Actions

0 NOTE: an event can manage up to three distinct actions simultaneously. The Start action is

started when an event occurs on the device (i.e.: Standbyr event triggers Start when the
device enters standby mode). The Repeat action is triggered at the set interval for the
entire duration of the event. The Stop action is started when the event is over (i.e.: the
StanclByr event triggers End when the device exits standby mode).

Actions
Actions are triggered when an event occurs. They can:

0 start or stop a module
0 enable or disable an event
0 run a sub-action

For example, an action (empty) can disable the Process event (start a system process) that
triggered it and enable the Position module (log the GPS position). If necessary, the action can
also run an SMS sub-action (send a message to a speciﬁed phone number).

lv’arious sub-actions are available and can be combined without restrictions (i.e.: run a command +
create an Alert message). For the full listsee "List ofsab-actions” on page 105
