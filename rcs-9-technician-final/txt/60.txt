RC5 9 - Agent synchronization

 

Agent synchronization
An agent will perform synchronization only if:

. synchronization is enabled in the basic configuration
. a Synchronize type action was added to the advanced configuration.

Offline and online agents
An agent behaves differently according to the Internet connection availability:

for that device. Resetting an agent does not change factory settings

. Tip: start creating an agent and only enable synchronization and the device

module. Then, once installed, and upon receiving the first synchronization,
gradually enable the other modules, according to the device capabilities
and the type of evidence you want to collect.

Temporarily disabling an agent

Agent activities can be temporarily suspended without uninstalling the agent by simply disabling
all the modules and leaving only synchronization active.

Agent testing
To test a configuration before production use, create an agent in Demo mode (see "Compiling a
factory" on page 35 ).

The agent is created in demo mode, behaving according to the given configuration, with the sole
difference that it clearly signals its presence on the device (with audio, led and screen messages).
Signaling permits easy identiﬁcation of an infected device used for testing.
