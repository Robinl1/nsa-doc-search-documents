What you should know about agents

Agent installation

The agent can be exposed and identified if installed in environments with antivirus or in
environments managed by expert technicians.

To prevent this from happening, a substitute, the scout agent, is sent at installation to infect the
target device and check the environment.

Once installed, the scout agent appears in the target page after the first synchronization. Its icon,
similar to the agent one, indicates the platform where it is installed. For example:

0 g : scout agent installed on a Windows device

0 : scout agent installed on a BlackBerry device

Evidence acquisition for installation environment analysis
After installation is completed, the scout agent acquires evidence:
0 Screenshot type to help identify the target device
0 Device type to help understand whether the environment to be infected is ok or whether
there are applications that could compromise agent integrity.

- IMPORTANT: Screenshot type evidence is only collected if the module is enabled in
the configuration. If necessary, remember to enable it before sending the agent.

Installation environment analysis

After the scout agent acquires evidence, it must be checked to decide whether the installation
environment is safe for the agent.

If the environment is safe, the agent can be updated; the scout agent is replaced by the agent.
If the environment is not safe, the scout agent must be closed.

Updating the scout agent

Updating the scout agent installs the agent and the scout agent icon is replaced by the agent icon
in the target page.

0 El: agent installed on a Windows device

E3
0 : agent installed on a BlackBerry device
