Infection via manual identification

Following are the steps required to infect manually identified devices. The operator's goal is to
identify target devices.

The attack can be run on wired or WiFi networks:

Phase Description Where

 

1 Prepare identification rules that include manual identification and RC5 Consoie,
injection rules for all the target devices to be attacked. Send the System,

rules to Tactical Network Injector. Network injector
2 Enable synchronization with RC5 to receive updated rules. Tacticai

3 If target devices are connected to a protected WiFi network, Tacticai

4 If target devices can connect to an open WiFi network, try Tacticai

6 Select dewces and Infect them.

Enable synchronization with RC5

Tactical Control Center receives the updated software and identification and injection rules from
RC5 and sends logs.

In this communication, RCS will attempt to communicate with Tactical Network Injector at set
intervals (about 30 sec.). In Tactical Control Center, decide when to enable synchronization using
the Network Injector function.
