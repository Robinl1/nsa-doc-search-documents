RCS 9 - U3 Installation vector

 

U3 Installation vector

Purpose

Compiling creates an ISO auto-installer to be written on a U3 key (SanDisk) using the U3
customizer program (the software can be downloaded from Internet).

When the key is inserted in the device, a menu opens for agent installation (no USB disk is
automatically detected).

Operating systems
Windows

Parameters
None.

Exploit vector (mobile)

Purpose

Compiling creates an installer that, executed on the target device, results in the device being
infected.

Different behaviors may be experienced, depending on the speciﬁc Exploit (i.e. the running
program is aborted).

Installation
The installer must be copied to the device and install.sh run from the copied folder.

0 IMPORTANT: the device must be unlocked.

The packet of utility files is automatically copied to the folder C:\RCS\Collector\public. These ﬁles
may be used in many types of attacks (i.e.: via link from a website).

Deleting no longer used files

Packets saved in the folder C:\RCS\Collector\public can be deleted using the File Manager
function, see "Frontend management".

Example of installer copy command on the iOS device
mymac>scp —r .XRCS_IPHONE root@myiphone.local.net:/tmp

mymac>ssh root@myiphone.local.net
myiphone>cd ftmp/RCS_IPHONE
