What you should know about advanced configuration

Advanced configuration

Advanced factory/agent configuration lets you create complex activation sequences using a
simple graphic interface.

The purpose of the sequence is to start/stop evidence collection, and/or run an action when an
event occurs.

Advanced configuration always includes two basic sequences:

0 At each synchronization (Loop event), acquire device information (Start module action +

Device module)
At the end of the synchronization interval (Tim er-Loop event), run synchronization
between the agent and RCS (Synchronize action)

Following is an image that illustrates the two basic sequences recommended for remote data
acquisition:
