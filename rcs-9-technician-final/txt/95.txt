RCS 9 - Identifying when Network Injector is synchronized

 

Identifying when Network Injector is synchronized
The procedure is described below:

Step Action

 

1 In the Monitor section, select the Network Injector object row to be analyzed. Check
the Status column: if flagged green, the Network Injector is synchronized.

This situation occurs when on Control Center software (Appliance or Tactical):
o Config was clicked, the operator manually queued for new rules or updates,-
0 Start was clicked or an infection is in progress.

IMPORTANT: applied rules and updates can only be received from RC5
when Network Injector is synchronized.

What you should know about Appliance Control Center

Introduction
Appliance Control Center is an application installed on Network Injector Appliance.

Synchronization with RC5 server

Appliance Control Center synchronizes with RCS to receive the updated infection rules and to
check whether a new version of Appliance Control Center is available and send logs.

Synchronization can occur in two ways:

0 manually, at least the first time, to receive injection rules, using the Appliance Control
Center Network Injector function.
It automatically with an infection in progress.

During synchronization, RCS communicates with Network Injector Appliance at set intervals of
time (about 30 sec.).

Injection interface IP address

For infection to be successful, the infection interface must have a public address, otherwise the
target will never be able to see it.

In an initial phase you can use the preset address on the interface with Appliance Control Center
(with Public IP= "auto"), wait for a message that indicates that the address is private and, in that
case, set a public address to re-route the private address (Public IP = "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"j.

Sniffing, on the other hand, can be run via the network interface with a private IP address.
