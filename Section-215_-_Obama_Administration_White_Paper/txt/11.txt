States v. Arthur Young & Co., 465 U.S. 805, 814 (1984) (stating that IRS’s statutory power to
subpoena any records that may be relevant to a particular tax inquiry allows IRS to obtain items
“of even potential relevance to an ongoing investigation”) (emphasis in original). Relevance in
that context is not evaluated in a vacuum but rather through consideration of the nature, purpose,
and scope of the investigation, see, e.g., Oklahoma Press Pub. Co. v. Walling, 327 US. 186, 209
(1946), and courts generally defer to an agency’s appraisal of what is relevant. See, e.g., EEOC
v. Randstad, 685 F.3d 433, 451 (4th Cir. 2012).

In light of that basic understanding of relevance, courts have held that the relevance
standard permits requests for the production of entire repositories of records, even when any
particular record is unlikely to directly bear on the matter being investigated, because searching
the entire repository is the only feasible means to locate the critical documents.7 More generally,
courts have concluded that the relevance standard permits discovery of large volumes of
information in circumstances where the requester seeks to identify much smaller amounts of
information within the data that directly bears on the matter.8 Federal agencies exercise broad
subpoena powers or other authorities to collect and analyze large data sets in order to identify
information that directly pertains to the particular subject of an investigation.9 Finally, in the
analogous ﬁeld of search warrants for data stored on computers, courts permit Government
agents to copy entire computer hard drives and then later review the entire drive for the specific
evidence described in the warrant. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(e)(2)(B) (“A warrant may

 

7 See, e.g., Carrillo Huettel, LLP v. SEC, 2011 WL 601369, at *2 (SD. Cal. Feb. 11, 2011) (holding that there is
reason to believe that law firm’s trust account information for all of its clients is relevant to SEC investigation,
where the Government asserted the trust account information “may reveal concealed connections between
unidentified entities and persons and those identified in the investigation thus far . . . [and] the transfer of funds
cannot effectively be traced without access to all the records”); Goshawk Dedicated Ltd. v. Am. Viatical Servs.,
LLC, 2007 WL 3492762 at *1 (ND. Ga. Nov. 5, 2007) (compelling production of business’s entire underwriting
database, despite business’s assertion that it contained a signiﬁcant amount of irrelevant data); see also Chen-Oster
v. Goldman, Sachs & Co., 285 F.R.D. 294, 305 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (noting that production of multiple databases could
be ordered as a “data dump” if necessary for plaintiffs’ statistical analysis of business’s employment practices).

8 See, e.g., In re Subpoena Duces Tecum, 228 F.3d 341, 350-51 (4th Cir. 2000) (holding that subpoena to doctor to
produce 15,000 patient files was relevant to investigation of doctor for healthcare fraud); In re Grand Jury
Proceedings, 827 F.2d 301, 305 (8th Cir. 1987) (upholding grand jury subpoenas for all wire money transfer records
of business’s primary wire service agent in the Kansas City area that exceeded $1000 for a one year period despite
claim that “the subpoena may make available to the grand jury records involving hundreds of innocent people”); In
re Adelphia Comm. Corp., 338 BR. 546, 549 and 553 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2005) (permitting inspection of
“approximately 20,000 large bankers boxes of business records,” and holding that “[i]t is well-settled . . . that sheer
volume alone is an insufficient reason to deny discovery of documents”); Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc. v.
Michelson, 229 F.R.D. 550, 552 (W.D. Tenn. 2003) (concerning discovery request for “approximately 996 network
backup tapes, containing, among other things, electronic mail, plus an estimated 300 gigabytes of other electronic
data that is not in a backed-up format, all of which contains items potentially responsive to discovery requests”).

9 See, e.g., F .T.C. v. Invention Submission Corp., 965 F.2d 1086 (DC. Cir. 1992) (upholding broad subpoena for
financial information in FI’C investigation of unfair or deceptive trade practices because it “could facilitate the
Commission’s investigation . . . in different ways, not all of which may yet be apparent”); see also Associated
Container Transp. (Aus.) Ltd. v. United States, 705 F.2d 53, 58 (2nd Cir. 1983) (“recognizing the broad
investigatory powers granted to the Justice Department by the Antitrust Civil Process Act,” which are broad in scope
due to the “‘less precise nature of investigations’”) (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 94-1343, at 11 (1976)).
