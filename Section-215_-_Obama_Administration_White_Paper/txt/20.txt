Commission’s investigative authority.”); Haig v. Agee, 453 US. 280, 297-98 (1981) (finding that
where Congress used language identical to that in an earlier statute and there was “no evidence
of any intent to repudiate the longstanding administrative construction” of the earlier statute, the
Court would “conclude that Congress . . . adopted the longstanding administrative construction”
of the prior statute); Atkins v. Parker, 472 US. 115, 140 (1985) (“Congress was thus well aware
of, and legislated on the basis of, the contemporaneous administrative practice . . . and must be
presumed to have intended to maintain that practice absent some clear indication to the
contrary.”) (citing Haig, 453 US. 297—98).15

III. THE TELEPHONY METADATA COLLECTION PROGRAM IS
CONSTITUTIONAL

The telephony metadata collection program also complies with the Constitution.
Supreme Court precedent makes clear that participants in telephone calls lack any reasonable
expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment in the metadata records generated by their
telephone calls and held by telecommunications service providers. Moreover, any arguable
privacy intrusion arising from the collection of telephony metadata would be outweighed by the
critical public interest in identifying connections between terrorist operatives and thwarting
terrorist plots, rendering the program reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.
The program is also consistent with the First Amendment, particularly given that the database
may be used only as an investigative tool in authorized investigations of international terrorism.

A. Fourth Amendment

A Section 215 order for the production of telephony metadata is not a “search” as to any
individual because, as the Supreme Court has expressly held, participants in telephone calls lack
any reasonable expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment in the telephone numbers
dialed. In Smith v. Maryland, 442 US. 735 (1979), the Supreme Court held that the
Govemment’s collection of dialed telephone numbers from a telephone company did not
constitute a search of the petitioner under the Fourth Amendment, because persons making
phone calls lack a reasonable expectation of privacy in the numbers they call. Id. at 743-46.

 

15 Moreover, in both 2009 and 2011, when the Senate Judiciary Committee was considering possible amendments
to Section 215, it made clear that it had no intention of affecting the telephony metadata collection program that had
been approved by the FISC. The Committee reports accompanying the USA PATRIOT Act Sunset Extension Acts
of 2009 and 2011 explained that proposed changes to Section 215 were “not intended to affect or restrict any
activities approved by the FISA court under existing statutory authorities.” S. Rep. No. 111-92, at 7 (2009); S. Rep.
No. 112-13, at 10 (2011). Ultimately, Section 215 and other expiring provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act were
extended to June 1, 2015 without change. See Patriot Sunsets Extension Act of 2011, Pub. L. No. 112-14, 125 Stat.
216 (2011). Likewise, Senators in the minority expressed the desire not to interfere with any activities carried out
under Section 215 that had been approved by the FISC. See S. Rep. No. 111-92, at 24 (2009) (additional views from
Senators Sessions, Hatch, Grassley, Kyl, Graham, Comyn, and Coburn) (“It should be made clear that the changes
to the business record and pen register statutes are intended to codify current practice under the relevance standard
and are not intended to prohibit or restrict any activities approved by the FISA Court under existing authorities”).
This record is further evidence of awareness and approval by Members of Congress of the FISC’s decision that
Section 215 authorizes the telephony metadata collection program.
