Passive Collection

 

 

 

° EONBLUE

— Global Access capability deployed across collection programs,
including SPECIALSOURCE and CANDLEGLOW (FORNSAT).

I — Provides passive cyber-threat detection.

— Allowed us to find additional infrastructure by using signatures
for known SNOWGLOBE beacons

° Traditional

— As always, a huge asset

— With passive access, we were able to see an operator log in to
an LP
- Single-token authentication + weak hash = breakthrough.

- Seeing the operator log in provided enough to get into the LPs for
ourselves.
