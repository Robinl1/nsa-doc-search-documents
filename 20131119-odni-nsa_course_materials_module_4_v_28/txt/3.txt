) (SV Character): Access to BR and PRITT raw metadata and query results is restricted to those who have the required training and appropriate
credentials. The Ofﬁce of the Director of Compliance (ODOC) through the Signals Intelligence Directorate‘s Ofﬁce of Oversight and Compliance (SV)
controls access to the BR and PR/TT FISA metadata, ensuring that only those who have completed all ofthe required training and have been granted the
appropriate credentials are permitted to touch the metadata.

(IS/48W) \Mthin the analyst workforce, a distinction is made between individuals who are permitted to quer the data and those who are permitted only
to view the query results. Individuals who are authorized to query BR and PR/TT metadata sets have —credentials. Division level
management within a production center determines when query permissions will be granted to analysts based on a mission need, not solely on completion
of BR and PR/TT FISA Training. Some technical personnel may also require query access, but their queries are for the purposes of data accuracy and
integrity, not for target or intelligence analysis. Managers of technical personnel who require query permissions will make the determination in concert with
their organization’s compliance ofﬁce, usually either SV or TV (the Technology Directorate’s ofﬁce of compliance).
