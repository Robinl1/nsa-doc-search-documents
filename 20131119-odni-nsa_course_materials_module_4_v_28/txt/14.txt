(ISAlSI-ALNF) (HMC Character): Once you are operating within the BR or PR/TT mode of — remember that you may only use a RAS-approved
identifier to query the metadata. A RAS-approved identiﬁer that is used to initiate a query of BR or PR/TT metadata is referred to as a “seed“ since it is
being used to produce a “chain" of metadata contacts, known as contact chaining.

(IS#SI#NF) -emp|oys the EAR software to provide reasonable assurance that only RAS-approved identifiers are queried by analysts. Before
executing a query on an identiﬁer, the EAR verifies that the identiﬁer is RAS-approved. If an analyst attempts to query a non-RAS-approved identiﬁer while
still in BR or PR/TT query mode, the EAR will provide reasonable assurance that no results are returned for that query; this includes data not derived from
BR or PR/TT. This query will, however. be reflected in SV’s auditing and a justiﬁcation for the query attempt may be requested. If you are unsure whether
an identifier is RAS-approved, use _to determine the identifier’s approval status.
