responsibility is assigned only to the positions named in the BR and PR/TT Court Orders. Let’s say, for example, that the Chief and Deputy Chief of
Information Sharing Services Office, the two individuals who on a normal daily basis would be making the decision, are both on vacation on the same day.
In this instance, someone else within their ofﬁce may be the acting chief on that day; however, the acting chief cannot make the decision to disseminate
US. person information.

(IFSALSWN-F) (HMC Character): Underthese circumstances, if information about a US. person must be disseminated on that day, then you should send
your dissemination request to one of the other positions named in the Orders. This would logically be the NSOC SOO.

(IFSALSWN-F) (OGC Attorney): With respect to non-U.S. person information, standard NSA practices and policies (such as proper sourcing information)
apply.
