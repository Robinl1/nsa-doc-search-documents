(IFSALSWN-F) (OGC Attorney): Now let’s focus our attention on the dissemination of BR and PR/TT results. We deﬁne dissemination of BR and PR/TT
results as distributing information to external customers in any form to include oral or written form. Let‘s say you perform a BR or PR/TT query using a
RAS-approved identifier, and the query returns good foreign intelligence information based on unique BR or PR/TT metadata that you would like to report
to Intelligence Community customers. What should you do? In this topic we will discuss to what extent we can use standard processes and procedures for
the dissemination ofthis information and to what extent we must use special processes and procedures for the dissemination ofthis speciaI foreign
intelligence information. Given the sensitive nature ofthis Program, you will not be surprised to hear that there are special rules that apply to the

dissemination of this information.
