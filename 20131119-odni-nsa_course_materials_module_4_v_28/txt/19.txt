(TSA‘SI-ALNF) (HMC Character): In the examples we just discussed, none ofthe results were unique to any one collection authority. Frequently, however,
you’ll ﬁnd that some of the results within the chain are unique to one particular collection authority. A BR- or PR/TT-unique query result is any piece of
information that NSA would not have had but for the BR or PR/TT metadata from which it was drawn. In other words, BR or PR/TT was the ONLY source of
that individual contact/query result.

 

 

(MSW) Here are some examples: example A is “E.O. 12333-unique,“ while B is “PR/TT-unique,“ and C is “BR-unique.“i __ [Comment [a12]: Againshow previous examples]

to allow learner to look at the examples. Please
allow some “quiet” space that can be duplicated
