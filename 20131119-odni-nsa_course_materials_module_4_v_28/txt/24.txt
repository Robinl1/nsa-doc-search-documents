collection source in addition to BR or PR/TT, the rules governing the other collection authority would apply to the handling and sharing ofthat query result.
For example, this result came from both BR and E0. 12333 collection; therefore, because it is not unique to BR information, it would be okto inform non-
BR cleared individuals of the fact of this communication, as well as task, query, and report this information according to standard E.O. 12333 guidelines.

(ISLISl-ALN-F) (SV Character) In summary, if a query result has multiple collection authorities, analysts should source and/or report the non-BR or PR/TT
version ofthat query result according to the rules governing the other authority. But if it is unique to either the BR or PRlTT authority then it is a unique
query result with all ofthe applicable BR and PR/TT restrictions placed on it. In both cases, however, analysts should not share the actual chain containing
BR or PR/TT results with analysts who do not have the credentials to receive or view BR or PR/TT information. In such an instance, if it is necessary to
share the chain, analysts should re-run the query in the non-BR or non-PR/TT areas of-' and share that .cml.
