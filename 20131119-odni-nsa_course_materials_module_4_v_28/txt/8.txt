(ISAlSI-ALNF) (OGC Attorney): Another aspect of data access and governance is the requirement for the sourcing of BR and PR/TT metadata records. As we
mentioned in Module 2, the metadata must carry unique markings, or tags. These tags allow the analyst to determine if a particular piece of information is
derived from either the BR or PR/TT repository. In addition, these markings enable the EAR software and other management controls to function properly.
