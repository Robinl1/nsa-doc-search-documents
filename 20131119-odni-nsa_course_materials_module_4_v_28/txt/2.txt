FISC Orders could be jeopardized by inadvertent or unintended changes in the infrastructure maintained by technical personnel. Therefore, an
understanding ofthe requirements outlined in the Orders is important in the event that any technical support functions (data access, presentation,
underlying system support — both hardware and software, etc.) cause changes to the support infrastructure that would bring NSA’s compliance with the BR
and PR/TT Court Orders into question.
