(ISLISl-ALN-F) (OGC Attorney): Before we discuss sharing and handling restrictions of BR- and PR/TT-unique query results,it is important to understand that
a BR or PR/TT query result is not just a line within the chain that is presented to you after you run a BR or PR/TT query in —Any information that
you derive, extract, or manipulate from that particular line in the chain becomes a BR or PR/TT result. Given that a source of the result is derived from BR
or PR/TT metadata, any adaptation ofthat result, including information provided orally or in writing, even a tip or a lead, remains a BR or PR/TT query
result.

(ISLISl-ALN-F) (OGC Attorney): In addition, other examples of items that have been deemed to be BR and PR/TT query results include:
o A speciﬁc identifier
o “Identiﬁer A was in contact with ldentifier B"
o A .ile (for example the entire contact chain/result set) that contains BR or PR/TT query results

 

 

o A written or electronic depiction of a chain (like the -ﬁle litself) or the analysis or partial analysis of a chain that includes BR or PR/TT results.--- Comment [SL514]: Note for audio recording,
