(ISAISI-ALNF) (HMC Character): 80, for example, if you run a BR or PR/TT query on a particular RAS-approved e-maiI identifier and it returns information
that depicts identifier A, the RAS-approved seed, was in direct contact with identifier B and the source ofthe metadata is BR or PR/TT, then just the fact
that identiﬁer A is communicating with identiﬁer B is considered a BR or PR/TT query result.

(ISLISI-ﬂﬂN-F) (HMC Character): In addition, any summary of that information would also be a BR or PR/TT query result. So, if you knew that identifier A
belonged to Joe and identiﬁer B belonged to Sam, and the fact ofthat contact was derived from BR or PR/TT metadata, if you communicate orally or in
writing that Joe talked to Sam, even if you don’t include the actual e-mail account or telephone numbers that were used to communicate, this is still a BR or
PR/TT query result.

(ISALSI-ALNF) (OGC Attorney): Remember, if these results are determined to be BR- or PR/TT-UNIQUE. they are subject to sharing and handling
restrictions.
