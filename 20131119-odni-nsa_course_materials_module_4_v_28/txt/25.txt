(IS#Sl#N-F) (OGC Attorney): The Court Orders mandate destruction ofthe metadata five years or 60 months after initial collection. NSA destroys the BR
and PR/TT metadata no later than ﬁve years after collection. There are no exceptions to this requirement when it comes to the bulk metadata.

(IS#S|#NF) (HMC Character): The destruction requirement applies to the bulk metadata; it does not apply to query results that have been generated as a
result of queries of RAS-approved identifiers. Once we have queried the metadata we have selected metadata, or query results, and the 60-month cutoff
does not apply.
