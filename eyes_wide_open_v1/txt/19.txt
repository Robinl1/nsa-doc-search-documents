names of Australian persons mentioned in foreign communications."68

A 2007 document explains that this is no longer an expectation, as the Five Eyes are
consenting to the broad trawling of data incidentally intercepted by other Five Eyes
partners. The document explains:
"Sigint [signals intelligence] policy and the UK Liaison Office here at NSAW
[NSA Washington] worked together to come up with a new policy that expands the
use of incidentally collected unminimized UK data in SIGINT analysis[...] Now SID
analysts can unminimize all incidentally collected UK contact identifiers, including IP
and email addresses, fax and cell phone numbers, for use in analysis."69

Outside the Second Party partners that make up the Five Eyes, there is no ambiguity
about who else can be spied on, including third party partners. An internal NSA
presentation made clear ”[w]e can, and often do, target the signals of most 3rd party
foreign partners."70 In other words, the intelligence services of the Five Eyes agencies
may spy on each other, with some expectation that they will be consulted when this
occurs; everyone else is fair game, even if they have a separate intelligence-sharing
agreement with one or several Five Eyes members.

This understanding that allies may still be spied upon has been echoed in other public
statements made by the US, which in the wake of the Snowden revelations has
confirmed, through an unnamed senior official, that "we have not made across the
board changes in policy like, for example, terminating intelligence collection that might
be aimed at all allies."71

Spying on heads of State

Questions remain, however, as to whether arrangements within Five Eyes may prevent
the surveillance of the respective heads of States of Five Eyes partners. It has been
confirmed by the White House that UK Prime Minister David Cameron’s communications
”have not, are not and will not be monitored by the US.”72 However, while New Zealand
Prime Minister John Key has agreed that he is satisfied that the US has not spied on him
and that he is ”confident of the position," he will not confirm whether this is because the
Five Eyes members have agreed to this.75 Additionally after German Chancellor Angela
