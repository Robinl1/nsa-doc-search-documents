(6) acquisition of information regarding communications organizations,
procedures, practices and equipment.

A draft of the original UKUSA agreement, declassified in 2010, explains that the
exchange of the above-listed information

”will be unrestricted on all work undertaken except when specifically excluded from
the agreement at the request of either party to limit such exceptions to the absolute
minimum and to exercise no restrictions other than those reported and mutually
agreed upon."

Indeed, in addition to facilitating collaboration, the agreement suggests that all
intercepted material would be shared between Five Eyes States by default. The text
stipulates that ”all raw traffic shall continue to be exchanged except in cases where one
or the other party agrees to forgo its copy."

The working arrangement that was reached in 1955 by UKUSA parties explained that
”while Commonwealth countries other than the UK are not party to the UKUSA COMINT
agreement, they will not be regarded as Third Parties."4 lnstead ”Canada, Australia and
New Zealand will be regarded as UKUSA-collaborating Commonwealth countries," also
known as Second Parties. One retired senior NATO intelligence officer has suggested
”there is no formal over-arching international agreement that governs all Five Eyes
intelligence relationships."5 It is not known how accurate that statement is, or how the
agreement has been modified in subsequent years as the text of the Five Eyes
agreement in its current form has never been made public.

Today, GCHQ simply states it has ”partnerships with a range of allies [...] [o]ur
collaboration with the USA, known as UKUSA, delivers enormous benefits to both
nations."6 The NSA makes no direct reference to the UKUSA arrangement or the Five
Eyes States by name, except by way of historical references to partnerships with ”the
British and the Dominions of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand” in the
declassification section of their website.7

The original agreement mandated secrecy, stating ”it will be contrary to this agreement
to reveal its existence to any third party unless otherwise agreed” resulting in modern
day references to the existence of the agreement by the intelligence agencies remaining
