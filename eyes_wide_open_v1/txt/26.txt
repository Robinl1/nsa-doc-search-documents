which public authorities are empowered to resort to this secret and potentially
dangerous interference."99

It must be clear ”what elements of the powers to intercept are incorporated in legal rules
and what elements remain within the discretion of the executive" and the law must
indicate ”with reasonable clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the relevant
discretion conferred on the public authorities"100 in order that individuals may have some
certainty about the laws to which they are subject and regulate their conduct
accordingly.

Yet ”the degree of certainty will depend on the circumstances."101 As the Court has
noted, ”foreseeability in the special context of secret measures of surveillance, such as
the interception of communications, cannot mean that an individual should be able to
foresee when the authorities are likely to intercept his communications so that he can
adapt his conduct accordingly..."102

Where a power vested in the executive is exercised in secret, however, the risks of
arbitrariness are evident: in the words of the Court in Weber v Germany, ”a system of
secret surveillance for the protection of national security may undermine or even destroy
democracy under the cloak of defending it."105 In such circumstances, ”is essential to
have clear, detailed rules on the subject, especially as the technology available for use is
continually becoming more sophisticated..."104

What, then, does human rights law require of a law in order to ensure secret surveillance
does not infringe the principles of accessibility and foreseeability? The Court’s decision
in Weber is authoritative on this point:

”In its case law on secret measures of surveillance, the Court has developed the
following minimum safeguards that should be set out in statute law in order to
avoid abuses of power: the nature of the offences which may give rise to an
interception order; a definition of the categories of people liable to have their
telephones tapped; a limit on the duration of telephone tapping; the procedure to
be followed for examining, using and storing the data obtained; the precautions to
be taken when communicating the data to other parties; and the circumstances in
which recordings may or must be erased or the tapes destroyed."105
