surveillance in their own corners of the world. Those recipients included Canada,
[...] Britain, Australia and New Zealand."45

Analysis tools such as these have been developed in secret over many years, often at
huge cost. That this tool was shared, even in trial version with Five Eyes partners, is an
important indicator of how tightly integrated the relationship is. Subsequent related

programmes codenamed TRAILBLAZER, TURBULENCE and TRAFFICTHIEF were later

adopted and used by Five Eyes partners.46

More recently, the Guardian reported47 that 500 analysts from GCHQ and 250 from the
NSA were directly assigned to examine material collected under the TEMPORA
programme. By placing taps at key undersea fibre optic cable landing stations, the
programme is able to intercept a significant portion of the communications that
traverses the UK. TEMPORA stores content for three days and metadata for 50 days.
Once content and data are collected, they can be filtered.

The precise nature of GCHQ’s filters remains secret. Filters could be applied based on
type of traffic (e.g. Skype, Facebook, Email), origin/destination of traffic, or to conduct
basic keyword searches, among many other purposes. Reportedly, approximately 40,000
search terms have been chosen and applied by GCHQ, and another 51,000 by the NSA
to information collected via TEMPORA.

GCHQ have had staff examining collected material since the project’s inception in 2008,
with NSA analysts brought to trial runs of the technology in summer 2011. Full access
was provided to NSA by autumn 2011. An additional 850,000 NSA employees and US
private contractors with top-secret clearance reportedly also have access to GCHQ
databases. GCHQ boasted that it had ”given the NSA 56% of all the raw information
the British had intercepted from computers the agency was monitoring."48 Additional
reporting from GCHQ internal documents explains how they "can now interchange
100% of GCHQ End Point Projects with NSA."49

GCHQ received £100 million ($160 million) in secret NSA funding over the last three
years to assist in the running of this project. This relationship was characterized by Sir
David Omand, former Director of GCHQ, as ”a collaboration that’s worked very well
[...] [w]e have the brains; they have the money."50

47 An early version of TEMPORA is referred to as the Cheltenham Processing Centre, additionally
codenamed TINT, and is described as a "joint GCHQ/NSA research initiative". The Guardian quotes an
internal GCHQ report that claims "GCHQ and NSA avoid processing the same data twice and proactively
seek to converge technical solutions and processing architectures." It was additionally reported that NSA
provided GCHQ with the technology necessary to sift through the material collected.
