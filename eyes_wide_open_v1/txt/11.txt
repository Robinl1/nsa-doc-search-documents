Policy and Plans from 1984-1987, for example, was an NSA employee.31

In addition to bases in Australia and New Zealand, Britain’s history of Empire left GCHQ
with a widespread network of SIGINT outposts. Intelligence stations in Bermuda,
Cyprus, Gibraltar, Singapore and Hong Kong have all played critical collection roles over
the past 60 years.

One of the largest listening posts outside the US is based in northern England, yet has
been under US ownership since the 1950s. In 1996 the base was renamed RAF Menwith
Hill and it was reported that for the first time the Union Jack was raised alongside the
Stars and Stripes. David Bowe, MEP for Cleveland and Richmond, said this was
”designed to mislead” and that "[m]y information is that the RAF representation on the
base amounts to one token squadron leader. The name change was presumably decided
to make the whole site look more benign and acceptable."32 The base was the subject of
a six billion pound investment over last 20 years, with the majority of that likely to be US
funds.33

Other bases, such as GCHQ’s operation in the South West of England at Bude, are also
jointly staffed. The Guardian reported34 that in addition to jointly developing the
TEMPORA program, 500 analysts from GCHQ and 250 from the NSA were located at
Bude and directly assigned to examine material collected under the programme.

In his seminal report Interception Capabilities 2000, Duncan Campbell named a number
of foreign orjointly run NSA bases. He wrote

”[t]he US Air Force installed 500 metre wide arrays known as FLR-9 at sites
including Chicksands, England, San Vito dei Normanni in Italy, Karamursel in
Turkey, the Philippines, and at Misawa, Japan. Codenamed "Iron Horse", the first
FLR-9 stations came into operation in 1964. The US Navy established similar bases
in the US and at Rota, Spain, Bremerhaven, Germany, Edzell, Scotland, Guam, and
later in Puerto Rico, targeted on Cuba."35

34 An early version of TEMPORA is referred to as the Cheltenham Processing Centre, additionally
codenamed TINT, and is described as a "joint GCHQ/NSA research initiative". The Guardian quotes an
internal GCHQ report that claims "GCHQ and NSA avoid processing the same data twice and proactively
seek to converge technical solutions and processing architectures." It was additionally reported that NSA
provided GCHQ with the technology necessary to sift through the material collected. The Guardian
reported that 300 analysts from GCHQ and 250 from NSA were directly assigned to examine the collected
material, although the number is now no doubt much larger. GCHQ have had staff examining collected
material since the project’s incarnation in 2008, with NSA analysts brought to trials in Summer 2011. Full
access was provided to NSA by Autumn 2011. An additional 850,000 NSA employees and US private
contractors with top secret clearance reportedly also have access to GCHQ databases
