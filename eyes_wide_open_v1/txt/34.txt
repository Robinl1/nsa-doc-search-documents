secret monitoring of communications entails a threat of surveillance for all those
to whom the legislation may be applied. This threat necessarily strikes at freedom
of communication between users of the telecommunications services and thereby
amounts in itself to an interference with the exercise of the applicants’ rights
under Article 8, irrespective of any measures actually taken against them."

The collection and storage of data that relates to an individual’s private life is so
invasive, and brings with it such risk of abuse, that it alone amounts to an interference
with the right to privacy, according to European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence.118
Accordingly, mass surveillance programmes must violate international law.

Jurisdiction and human rights obligations

Traditional conceptions of State human rights obligations focus on a nexus between the
territory where the obligation is owed and an individual’s connection with that territory
(by virtue of nationality, residence or physical location within it). In the context of
obligations under international human rights treaties, jurisdiction has traditionally served
as a doctrinal bar to the recognition and realization of human rights obligations extra-
territorially. Although, as noted by Milanovic:

”[q]uestions as to when a state owes obligations under a human rights treaty
towards an individual located outside its territory are being brought more and
more frequently, before courts both international and domestic. Victims of aerial
bombardment”, inhabitants of territories under military occupation120 — including
deposed dictatorsm, suspected terrorists detained in Guantanamo by the United
States122, and the family of a former KGB spy who was assassinated in London
through the use of a radioactive toxin, allegedly at the orders or with the collusion
of the Russian government123 — all of these people have claimed protection from
human rights law against a state affecting their lives while acting outside its
territory.”

Thejurisdiction clauses in two of the most relevant human rights instruments — the
European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights (ICCPR) — are notably different in their construction and numerous
