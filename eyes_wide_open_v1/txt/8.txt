released to the US, Australia, Canada, United Kingdom and New Zealand. The purpose
of the REL TO is to identify classified information that a party has predetermined to be
releasable (or has already been released) through established foreign disclosure
procedures and channels, to a foreign country or international organisation.14 Notably
while other alliances and coalitions exist such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
(e.g. TS// REL TO USA, NATO), European Counter-Terrorism Forces (e.g TS// REL TO
USA, ECTF) or Chemical Weapons Convention States (e.g. TS//REL TO USA, CWCS)
none of the documents that have thus far been made public refer to any of these
arrangements, suggesting the Five Eyes alliance is the preeminent SlGlNT collection
alliance.

The arrangement in this way was not just to create a set of principles of collaboration, or
the facilitation of information sharing, but to enable the dividing of tasks between
SlGlNT agencies. The agreement explains that

”[a]llocation of major tasks, conferring a one-sided responsibility, is undesirable
and impracticable as a main principle; however, in order that the widest possible
cover of foreign cypher communications be achieved the COMINT agencies of the
two parties shall exchange proposals for the elimination of duplication. In addition,
collaboration between those agencies will take the form of suggestion and mutual
arrangement as to the undertaking of new tasks and changes in status of old
tasks."15

The continuation of this sharing of tasks between agencies has been acknowledged with
former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger observing that the "United States has
neither the opportunity nor the resources to unilaterally collect all the intelligence
information we require. We compensate with a variety of intelligence sharing
arrangements with other nations in the world."16 The Canadian SlGlNT agency CSEC
explain how it ”relies on its closest foreign intelligence allies, the US, UK, Australia and
New Zealand to share the collection burden and the resulting intelligence yield."17 Other
former intelligence analysts have confirmed18 there is ”task-sharing” between the Five
Eyes groups.
