Chapter 1 — Understanding the Five Eyes

 

The birth of the Five Eyes alliance

Beginning in 1946, an alliance of five countries (the US, the UK, Australia, Canada and
New Zealand) developed a series of bilateral agreements over more than a decade that
became known as the UKUSA (pronounced yew-kew-zah) agreement, establishing the
Five Eyes alliance for the purpose of sharing intelligence, but primarily signals
intelligence (hereafter ”SIGINT"). While the existence of the agreement has been noted
in history books and references are often made to it as part of reporting on the
intelligence agencies, there is little knowledge or understanding outside the services
themselves of exactly what the arrangement comprises.

Even within the governments of the respective countries, which the intelligence agencies
are meant to serve, there has historically been little appreciation for the extent of the
arrangement. The arrangement is so secretive the Australian Prime Minister reportedly
wasn't informed of its existence until 19752. Former Prime Minister of New Zealand,
David Lange, once remarked that ”it was not until I read this book [Nicky Hager’s
”Secret Power", which detailed GCSB’s history] that I had any idea that we had been
committed to an international integrated electronic network." He continued: ”it is an
outrage that l and other ministers were told so little, and this raises the question of to
whom those concerned saw themselves ultimately answerable."3

There has been no debate around the legitimacy or purpose of the Five Eyes alliance in
part due to the lack of publicly available information about it. In 2010, the US and UK
declassified numerous documents, including memoranda and draft texts, relating to the
creation of the UKUSA agreement. However, generally the Five Eyes States and their
intelligence services have been far too slow in declassifying information that no longer
needs to be secret, resulting in no mention on any government website of the
arrangement until recently.

The intelligence agencies involved in the alliance are the United States National Security
Agency (NSA), the United Kingdom’s Government Communications Headquarters
(GCHQ), Canada’s Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC), the
Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), and New Zealand’s Government Communications
Security Bureau (GCSB).

The extent of the original arrangement is broad and includes the

(1) collection of traffic;
(2) acquisition of communications documents and equipment;
