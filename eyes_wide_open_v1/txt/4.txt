human rights framework in a way that provides rights and remedies to affected
individuals.

While the existence of the Five Eyes has been kept secret from the public and
parliaments, dogged investigative reporting from Duncan Campbell, Nicky Hager, and
James Bamford has gone some way to uncovering the extent of the arrangement. Now,
thanks to Edward Snowden, the public are able to understand more about the spying
that is being done in their name than ever before.

Trust must be restored, and our intelligence agencies must be brought under the rule of
law. Transparency around and accountability for these secret agreements is a crucial
first step.

Privacy International to grateful is Ben Jaffey, Caspar Bowden, Dan Squires, Duncan Campbell,
Eric Metcalfe, Ian Brown, James Bamford, Mark Scott, Marko Milanovic, Mathias Vermeulen,
Nicky Hager, Shamik Dutta, for their insight, feedback, discussions, investigation and support.
We are grateful to all of the whistleblowers whose responsible disclosures in the public interest
have brought transparency to the gross violations of human rights being conducted by the
intelligence agencies in our name.

Given the current rapid nature of information disclosures regarding the intelligence agencies, this

paper will be regularly updated to reflect the most accurate understanding we have of the nature
of the Five Eyes arrangement. Any errors or omission are solely attributable to the authors.
