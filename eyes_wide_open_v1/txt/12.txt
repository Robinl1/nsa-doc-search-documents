Many of these sites remain active, as an NSA presentation displaying the primary foreign
collection operations bases shows. The presentation36 details both the US sites

distributed around the world as well as the 2nd party bases as follows:

It is important to note that, just because a base is being operated from within a
particular country, this does not forestall Five Eyes parties from collecting intelligence
therein on the host country. Ex-NSA staff have confirmed that communications are
monitored from ‚Äùalmost every nation in the world, including the nations on whose soil
the intercept bases are located."39

Intelligence collection, analysis and sharing activities

It is believed that much of the intelligence collected under the Five Eyes arrangement can
be accessed by any of the Five Eyes partners at any time. Some codenamed
programmes that have been revealed to the public over the last decade go some way to
illustrating how the Five Eyes alliance collaborates on specific programmes of activity
and how some of this information is shared. It should be noted that these are just a
selection of programmes that have been made public, and are likely to represent a tiny
fraction of the joint collection undertaken by Five Eyes partners. Nevertheless these
codenamed programmes reveal just how integrated the Five Eyes SlGlNT collection and
analysis methods are, and the existence of shared SlGlNT tools and technologies
