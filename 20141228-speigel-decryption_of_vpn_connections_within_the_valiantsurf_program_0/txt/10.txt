(Ul/FOUO) One CA Server Toggled among Multiple TURMOILs

(Ul/FOUO) This section describes a network design to have one CA server serve multiple TURMOILs. Note that a CA Server can
only communicate to one TURMOIL at a time.

Motivation:

. Power/space/cooling limitations

. Long lead time to gain approval to add CA Services servers
. Hardware cost

. Limits on public IP address space at some sites
