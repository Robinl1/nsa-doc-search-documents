(SI/SI/IREL) DNC IKE SMG (Replaced Ike Analytic)

I (S) Description — The IKE SMG (Sesionized Metadata Generator) inherited the internal business logic of the IKE Analytic,
but was reehosted as an iBridge service. There is no longer any connection to PRESSUREWAVE or METROTUBE. The
IKESMG runs as a CCM graph IPSECilKE MDATA with input from IPSEC EVENT TO BME via IOPort.

I (S) Spin 17 , No Release. Initial version developed but not delivered to TURMOIL

I (S) Spin 18 — Initial Release. Patched Version had verbose logging.

I (S) Core 3.1 — Part of ValiantSurf Shark feather. APEX processing removed. Sessionization by Exchange introduced.

I (S) Core 4.): — Future release compliant with Schema version 8.

(SI/SI/IREL) DNC IKE Analytic

I (S) Spin 15 — No Release. Veriﬁed Spin 14 VIAS runs successfully on Metrotube 2.3.1 (Metrotube Spin 15 version).

I (S) Spin 14 — Upgraded Spagic workflow to follow the robust PWV Retriever Pattern.
I (S) Pattern Comprises separate service assemblies for Listener, Metadata Retriever, DataRetriever, Throttler, and DNC
wrapper.
I (S) Error handling and VIAS logging capabilities added.

I (S) APEX (DEMO) , Modiﬁed SOTF Parser and TGIF Record Factory to process Apex metadata.

I (S) Spin 13 — Upgraded Spagic workﬂow to match Metrotube 2.1.
I (S) Numerous bug ﬁxes relating to T0ygrippe content including Exchanges Types, Message Types, PhaseZAOnly,
missing transforms(see MadForge DNCeanalytic project for details).
I (S) Added capability to process Toygrippe ﬁle classiﬁcation determined by DNC Metadata.

I (S) Spin 12 , The VPN Analytic has been renamed as the VIAS (VPN IKE Analytic Service). In this spin, there were 2 major
changes.
I (S) First, the analytic was converted to run in the Metrotube 2 framework, as ajSorcerer Service on the Metrotube
Service Bus.
I (S) Second, the VIAS is now released by the ValiantSurf (DNC) team directly to Turbulence, where Spin 11 and earlier
versions were packaged by the DNC team, delivered informally to Metrotube Services who performed the software
release to Turbulence.

I (S) Spin 1 1 and prior — VPN Analytic runs as a Metrotube 1 service.
I (S) An improvement to the IkeSessionizer algorithm correctly matched up the initiator and responder by waiting for the
responder to return a non-ZRC (Zero Responder Cookie).
