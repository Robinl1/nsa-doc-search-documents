(U) Guidelines

I (UHFOUO) The fact that NSA is interested in DNC is UHFOUO.
I (Sf/REL) Just the fact that NSA does work with DNC is classiﬁed.
I (SI/REL) If the only information given is that you are a DNC expert or you work on DNCs, then the classification is
SHREL
I (TS/lSI/lORCON/REL) If the information given is that you decrypt DNCs, the classiﬁcation is, at a minimum TSHSI
l/ORCON/IREL
I (TS/fSlj/ORCON/REL) If the fact of DNC exploitation is mentioned or inferred (with or without mention ofa speciﬁc
target or person), the classification is TSHSIHORCONHREL
I (TS/lSI/lORCON/REL) The decryption results are classiﬁed, at a minimum, TSHSIHREL

(TS/lSI/lORCON/REL) The classifications above are the minimum classiﬁcations. A higher classification may be reguired
depending on the rest of the content. For example, mentioning you work on DNCs is SECRET/[REL but if you mention you work
on DNCs and are in CES, the classification should be TS/fSlj/ORCONHREL since CES deals with exploitation.

(U) DNC Protocols

(U) IPsec

(U) The IPsec DNC protocol suite comprises the following protocols: .
File:DNC IPSEC

- (U) ISAKMP — Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (RFC 2407, RFC 2408) Operation-1P9!
provides an authentication and key exchange framework. (U) IPsec DNC
I (U) IKE — Internet Key Exchange vl (RFC 2409) and v2(RFC 4306) provide an authentication and Operation

key exchange mechanism.

I (U) ESP , Encapsulating Security Payload (RFC 2406) provides traffic confidentiality (via encryption) and optionally
provides authentication and integrity protection.

I (U) AH — Authentication Header (RFC 2402) provides integrity and authentication protection the includes immutable IP
header fields. This differs from ESP integrity protection that does not include the IP header.

(U) PPTP

(U) The Point-torPoint Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) was developed in 1996 by the PPTP Forum, comprised of Ascend
Communications, US. Robotics, 3Com, Copper Mountain Networks, ECI Telematics, and lead by Microsoft.

(U) The Microsoft implementation of PPTP (RFC 2637) permits the data link layer protocol, Point-to—Point Protocol (PPP) (see
STD-0051), to be tunneled through an IP network, encapsulated within an enhanced/modified Generic Routing Encapsulation
(GRE) transport protocol (IP Next Protocol 47). The contents of the PPP data is normally IP network protocol packets for a
private network, but can also carry any other Local Area Network (LAN) protocol, like Microsoft NetBEUI or Novell IPX/SPX.
(U) Microsoft PPTP (MSrPPTP) permits the encapsulated PPP data to be authenticated using either version 1 (RFC 2433) or
version 2 (RFC 2759) of the Microsoft extensions to the PPP Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) (RFC 1994),

and to be encrypted using RC4 with key lengths of 40, 56, or 128 bits (RFC 3078, RFC 3079). The mode of the encryption is
negotiated and key lengths are exchanged using the PPP Compression Control Protocol (CCP) (RFC 1962).

(U) HOOKED

(TS/ISIIIREL) HOOKED HAND is a DNC protocol used in a commercial DNC product.

(U) CINDER

(TS/fSI/lREL) CINDERASH/TRACK are ESPrlike protocols that use nonrRFC deﬁned fields.
(U) DNSC

(TS/ISIIIREL) DNSC is

(U) TU DNC Products

(SI/SIIIREL) IPSec DNC Products

(S/fSlj/REL) The TU DNC products are the outputs of four processing data flows:

I (S/lSI/IREL) The TU DNC Metadata ﬂow collects metadata about IPsec (IKE/ISAKMP and ESP) events then forwards the
metadata to follow—on SIGINT Development (SIGDEV) systems.

I (TS/lSI/IREL) The TU DNC Decryption ﬂow detects IPsec communications, selects by IP—Address, decrypts the trafﬁc
selected for decryption, and re—injects the encapsulated (cleartext) content into TURMOIL for processing.
