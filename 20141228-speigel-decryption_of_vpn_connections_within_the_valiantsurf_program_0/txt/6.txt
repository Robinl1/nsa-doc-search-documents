(TSHSIIIORCONHRED Detailed Turmoil DNC Decryption Sequence Diagram

(TS/ISIIIREL) DNC Survey Flow

I [TS/ISI/IREL) The DNC Survey Flow detects, decrypts selected communications that are encrypted using IPsec; then
sessionizes the unencrypted packets and sends the sessions to XKEYSCORE. The DNC eventing [PPF) components in
TURMOIL detects all IKE/ISAKMP and ESP packets and queries KEYCARD for each unique IKE exchange session and each
unique ESP session to determine if the link should be selected for processing. Tasking is based on IP address. Decryption is
attempted if either the source or the destination IP address is tasked for decryption in KEYCARD [the KEYCARD tasking
action is labelled “TRANSFORM“ so as not to use the term “decrypt"). If KEYCARD returns a hit for an IKE packet, then the
IKE packet is sent to the POISONNUTtDNC Attack Orchestration) Service. If KEYCARD returns a hit for an ESP packet, a
key request is sent to POISONNUT A POISONNUT response message will either return the key or indicate that a key could
not be recovered. If a key is recovered, the ESP packets are decrypted and re—injected into TURMOIL for sessionization. If
KEYCARD also associated a “SURVEY" action with the DNC Tunnel IP-Address the encapsulated sessions are sent to
XKEYSCORE. The DNC Survey flow requires that both "TRANSFORM" and "SURVEY" actions are assigned to a targeted
IP-Address.

{TS/ISIHREL) All DNC Decryption functions and communications with POISONNUTtand a DNC Metrics service) are hosted
on a specially conﬁgured TURMOIL processor called a CA Server All CA Server software is loaded and administered by CES
approved and CA Server authorized administrators. The CA Server is ﬁrewalled and effectively functions as an extension of
the CES enclave. In the future all communications between the CA Server and the CES services (POISONNUT, DNC
Metrics) will use a secure jMS messaging service based on the ISLANDTRANSPORT/ ISLANDHIDEAWAY infrastructure.
