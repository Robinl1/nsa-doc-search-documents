(SISIHREL) So. SIGINT is down right cool. As much as we complain about our "Big Data Problem".
collectionfprocessing issues. dismal infrastructurefoutdated browserSIOS's. our ability to pull bits
out of random places of the Internet. bring them back to the mother-base to evaluate and build
intelligence off of is just plain awesome!

(SISIHREL) One of the coolest things about it is how much data we have at our fingertips. If we
*only* collected the data we knew we wanted...yeah. we'd fill some of our requirements. but this is
a whole world of possibilities we'd be missing! It would be like going on a road-trip. but wearing a
blindfold the entire time. and only removing it when you're at one of your destinations...yeah.
you'll still see stuff. but you'll be missing out on the entire journey!

(SISIHREL) So I decided to write a short series (affectionately titled '1 hunt ...'J on things that I'm
trying to do with data that wouldn't normally be interesting by itself. but by thinking about it in a
new way. makes it extremely valuable. My interests lately have been in using passive collect to
identifylenable CNE efforts. so that's predominantly what the first few topics will be about.

(UHFOUO) If there are any topics someone wants to see specifically. let me know. As well. if any of
the following information is useful. please let me know and I can put more out. Part 2 - Hunting
sys admins coming very soon!
