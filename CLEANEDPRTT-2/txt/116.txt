 

using the overcollected information. The Court has no basis to question that assertion.
Furthermore, high-level ofﬁcials at the Department of Justice and NSA have personally assured
the Court that they will closely monitor the acquisition and use of the bulk PR/TT collection to
ensure that the law, as reﬂected in the Court’s orders, is carefully followed by all responsible
ofﬁcials and employees. In light of the government’s assertions of need, and in heavy reliance on
the assurances of the responsible ofﬁcials, the Court is prepared — albeit reluctantly — to grant the
government’s request with respect to information that is not subject to Section 1809(a)(2)’s
prohibition. Hence, the government may access, use, and disseminate such information subject
to the restrictions and procedures described above that will apply to future collection.

The Court expects the responsible executive branch ofﬁcials to act with care and in good
faith in determining which portions of the prior collection are subject to Section 1809(a)(2)’s
prohibition. The authorization to use overcollected information falling outside the scope of the
criminal prohibition should not be understood as an invitation to disregard information that, if
pursued, would create a reason to know that data was obtained by unauthorized electronic
surveillance within the meaning of Section 1809(a)(2). The Court also expects the government
to keep it reasonably apprised with regard to efforts to segregate those portions of the prior
collection that it intends to use from the portions it is prohibited from using. Accordingly, the
Court will order that each of the 30-day reports described above include a description of those

efforts.
