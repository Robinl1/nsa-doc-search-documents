Court to authorize NSA to resume querying the prior collection in its entirety. S_ee Memorandum
of Law at 72-73. As discussed above, the Court continues to be satisﬁed that it may, pursuant to
Section 1842 and subject to appropriate restrictions, authorize NSA to acquire, in bulk, the
metadata associated with Internet communications transiting the United States. Further, although
Section 1842 does not explicitly require the application of minimization procedures to PR/TT-
acquired information, the Court also agrees that in light of the sweeping and non-targeted nature
of this bulk collection, it has authority to impose limitations on access to and use of the metadata
that NSA has accumulated.

The Court is satisﬁed that it may invoke the same authority to permit NSA to resume
querying the PR/TT information that was collected in accordance with the Court’s prior orders.
The Court is further persuaded that, in light of the government’s assertion of national security

government may access, use, and disseminate bulk PR/TT information that was collected in

information collected under docket number PR/TT and previous dockets is vital to NSA’s

information it collects prospectively with the information it collected [previously], there will be a
substantial gap in the information available to NSA”).
