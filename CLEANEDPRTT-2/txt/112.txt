 

“any authority granted by the Court has been implemented in a manner that did not comply with
the Court’s authorization,” to notify the Court of the incident and to explain, among other things,
“how the government proposes to dispose of or treat any information obtained as a result of the
non—compliance.” FISC Rule 10(c). Rule 10 does not explicitly give the Court the authority to
do anything. To be sure, the rule implicitly recognizes the Court’s authority, subject to PISA and
other applicable law, to ensure compliance with its orders and with applicable Court-approved
procedures. It does not, however, state or suggest that the Court is free in the event of an
overcollection to dictate any disposition of the overcollected material that it wishes, without
regard to other provisions of law, such as Section l809(a)(2).89

Finally, insofar as the government suggests that the Court has inherent authority to permit
the use and disclosure of all unauthorized collection without regard to Section 1809, sﬁ
Memorandum of Law at 73—74 & n.37, the Court again must disagree. To be sure, this Court,

like all other Article III courts, was vested upon its creation with certain inherent powers. See I_r_1
