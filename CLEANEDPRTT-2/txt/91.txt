 

NSA, the Director of the Signals Intelligence Directorate (SID), the Deputy Director of
the SID, the Chief of the Information Services (ISS) ofﬁce, the Deputy Chief of the ISS
ofﬁce, and the Senior Operation Ofﬁcer of the National Security Operations Center) must
determine that the information identifying the US. person is in fact related to
counterterrorism information and that it is necessary to understand the counterterrorism
information or assess its importance.

The differences are not material. Although the proposal refers speciﬁcally to “the
minimization and dissemination procedures of Section 7 of [USSID 18]” rather than to USSID
18 generally, the Court does not understand any difference in meaning to be intended; indeed,
Section 7 is the portion of USSID 18 that speciﬁcally covers disseminations outside NSA. S_ee
_Application, Tab C (USSID 18), at 8-10. With regard to the application of the
counterterrorism purpose requirement, the proposal adds two high—ranking NSA ofﬁcials (the
Deputy Director of the SID and the Deputy Chief of the ISS ofﬁce) to the list of ﬁve ofﬁcials
who were previously designated to make the required determination. The Court is aware of no
reason to think that the two additional ofﬁcials are less suited than the other ﬁve to make the
required determination, or that their designation as approving ofﬁcials will undermine the
internal check that is provided by having high-ranking NSA ofﬁcials approve disseminations that

include United States person identifying information”.

“share results derive rom inte 1gence analysis queries of the metadata, including US. person
identifying information, with Executive Branch personnel . . . in order to enable them to

determine whether the information contains excul ato or impeachment information or is
otherwise discoverable in legal proceedings.” ﬂAlexander Decl. 28-29; see als
