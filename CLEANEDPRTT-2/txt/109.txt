 

b. Section 1809(a)(2) Applies to the Prior Collection

The government does not contest that portions of the prior collection contain information
that the responsible officials know or have reason to know constitutes “electronic surveillance”
that was collected without the necessary authority. Instead, the government offers several
reasons why it believes Section 1809(a)(2) presents no bar to Court approval of use of the prior
collection. The Court ﬁnds the government’s contentions unpersuasive.

The government argues that the opening phrase of 50 U.S.C. § 1842(a) vests the Court
with authority to enter an order rendering Section 1809(a)(2) inapplicable. & Memorandum of
Law at 74 n. 37. The Court disagrees. Section 1842(a), which is entitled “Application for
authorization or approval,” provides in pertinent part as follows:

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Attorney General or a designated

attorney for the government may make an application for an order or an extension of an

order authorizing or approving the installation or use of a pen register or trap and trace

device for any investigation to obtain foreign intelligence information . . . .

As the context makes clear, the opening phrase “[n]othwithstanding any other provision of law”
in Section 1842 relates to the circumstances in which the government may apply for an order

permitting it to install and use a PR/TT device for foreign intelligence purposes. It does not

speak to the Court’s authority to grant a request for permission to use and disclose information
