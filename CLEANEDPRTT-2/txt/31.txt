categories,” and that Congress intended for DRAS information “to be synonymous with ‘non—
content.” _I_d_. at 23, 51. The Court is not persuaded that the government’s proposed construction
can be squared with the statutory text. The deﬁnition of pen register covers “a device or process
which records or decodes dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information transmitted by an
instrument or facility . . ., provided, however, that such information shall not include the contents
of any communication.” § 3127(3). The structure of the sentence — an afﬁrmative description of
the information to be recorded or decoded, followed by a proviso that “such information shall not
include the contents of any communication” —— does not suggest an intention by Congress to
create two mutually exclusive categories of information. Instead, the sentence is more naturally
read as conveying two independent requirements — the information to be recorded or decoded
must be DRAS information and, whether or not it is DRAS, it must not be contents. The same
observations apply to the similarly-structured deﬁnition of “trap and trace device.” See 18
U.S.C. § 3127(4) (“a device or process which captures the incoming electronic or other impulses
which identify the originating number or other dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling _
information reasonably likely to identify the source of a wire or electronic communication,
provided, however, that such information shall not include the contents of any communication”).

The breadth of the terms used by Congress to identify the categories of information
subject to collection and to deﬁne “contents” reinforces the conclusion that DRAS and contents

are not mutually exclusive categories. As the government observes, _s_e_e Memorandum of Law at
