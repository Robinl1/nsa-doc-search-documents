 

UNITED STATES
FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE COURT

WASHINGTON, DC.

 

 

 

MEMORANDUM OPINION
This matter is before the Court upon the government’s application to re-initiate in
expanded form a pen register/trap and trace (PR/TT) authorization for the National Security
Agency (N SA) to engage in bulk acquisition of metadata1 about Internet communications. The
government’s application also seeks Court authorization to query and use information previously

obtained by NSA, regardless of whether the information was authorized to be acquired under

 

I When used in reference to a communication, “metadata” is information “about the
communication, not the actual communication itself,” including “numbers dialed, the length of a
call, intemet protocol addresses, e-mail addresses, and similar information concerning the
delivery of the communication rather than the message between two parties.” 2 Wayne R.
LaFave, Jerold H. Israel, Nancy J. King & Orin S. Kerr, Criminal Procedure § 4.6(b) at 476 (3d
ed. 2007).
