 

number of restrictions on retention, use, and dissemination, some of which the government refers
to as “minimization” procedures. SE, Egg Memorandum of Law at 4, 17. The restrictions now
proposed by the government are similar, but not identical, to the rules that were adopted by the
Court in its —Order in Docket Number PR/TT_
Order”), the most recent order authorizing bulk PR/TT collection by NSA.

Absent any suggestion by the government that a different standard should apply, the
Court is guided in assessing the proposed restrictions by the deﬁnition of minimization

procedures in 50 U.S.C. § 1801(h).69 Because procedures satisfying that deﬁnition are sufﬁcient

 

69 Section 1801(h) deﬁnes “minimization procedures” in pertinent part as follows:

(1) speciﬁc procedures, which shall be adopted by the Attorney General, that are
reasonably designed in light of the purpose and technique of the particular
surveillance, to minimize the acquisition and retention, and prohibit the
dissemination, of nonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting
United States persons consistent with the need of the United States to obtain,
produce, and disseminate foreign intelligence information;

(2) procedures that require that nonpublicly available information, which is not
foreign intelligence information, as deﬁned in [50 U.S.C. § 1801(e)(l)], shall not
be disseminated in a manner that identiﬁes any United States person, without such
person’s consent, unless such person’s identity is necessary to understand foreign
intelligence information or assess its importance; [and]

(3) notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), procedures that allow for the retention
and dissemination of information that is evidence of a crime which has been, is

being, or is about to be committed and that is to be retained or disseminated for
law enforcement purposes[.]
