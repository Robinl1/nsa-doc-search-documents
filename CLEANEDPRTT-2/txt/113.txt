Chambers V. NASCO. Inc., 501 US. 32, 43 (1991) (“It has long been understood that [c]ertain
implied powers must necessarily result to our Courts of justice from the nature of their
institution . . . .”). It is well settled, however, that the exercise of such authority “is invalid if it
conﬂicts with constitutional or statutory provisions.” Thomas v. Am, 474 US. 140, 148 (1985).
And deﬁning crimes is not among the inherent powers of the federal courts; rather, federal crimes
are deﬁned by Congress and are solely creatures of statute. Bouslev v. United States, 523 US.
614, 620—21 (1998); United States v. Hudson, 11 US. (7 Cranch) 32, 34 (1812). Accordingly,
when Congress has spoken clearly, a court assessing the reach of a criminal statute must heed

US. 814, 831 (1974). The plain language of Section 1809(a)(2) makes it a crime for any person,
acting under color of law, intentionally to use or disclose information with knowledge or reason
to know that the information was obtained through unauthorized electronic surveillance. The
Court simply lacks the power, inherent or otherwise, to authorize the government to engage in

conduct that Congress has unambiguously prohibited.90

 

90 In its-espouse at page 4 n.1, the government added an alternative
request for the Court to amend all prior bulk PR/TT orders nunc p_r_o tune to permit acquisition of

the overcollected information. The Court denies that request. m p_r_o m relief is appropriate
to conform the record to a court’s original intent but is not a means to alter what was originally
intended or what actually transpired. See, e.g.. U.S. Philips Corp. v. KBC Bank N.V.. 590 F.3d
1091, 1094 (9th Cir. 2010) (citing cases). Here, the prior bulk PR/TT 0
Court intended to authorize the government to acquire only information
