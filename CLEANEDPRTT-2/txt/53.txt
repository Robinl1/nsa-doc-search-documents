 

communication, particularly relate to the transmission of the communication to its intended
party. By placing “signaling” Within the same list of types of communication-related
information, Congress presumably intended “signaling information” likewise to relate to the
transmission of a communication.

The wording of a related provision lends further support to this interpretation:

A government agency authorized to install and use a pen register or trap and trace

device . . . shall use technology reasonably available to it that restricts the

recording or decoding of electronic or other impulses to the dialing, routing,

addressing, and signaling information utilized in the processing and transmitting

of Wire or electronic communications so as not to include the contents of any Wire

or electronic communications.
18 U.S.C. § 3121(c) (emphasis added). Questions of available technology aside, there is no
reason to think Congress intended to compel an agency deploying a PR/TT device to try to avoid
acquiring data that would constitute DRAS information under the deﬁnitions of “pen register”
and “trap and trace device.” For this reason, Section 3121(c) strongly suggests that the intended

scope of acquisition under a PR/TT device is DRAS information utilized in the processing and

transmitting of a communication.48
