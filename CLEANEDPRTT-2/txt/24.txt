ﬁled on _he government then submitted its

revised, ﬁnal application 0-.., with those prior written responses attached as Exhibit

 

D.

To enter the PR/TT order requested in the current application, or a modiﬁed PR/TT order,
the Court must ﬁnd that the application meets all of the requirements of Section 1842. SE 50
U.S.C. § 1842(d)(l). Some of these requirements are plainly met: the government has submitted
to a judge of the FISC a written application that has been approved by the Attorney General (who
is also the applicant). sag _Application at 1, 20; 50 U.S.C. § 1842(a)(l), (b)(1), (c).
The application identiﬁes the Federal ofﬁcer seeking to use the PR/TT devices covered by it as
General Keith B. Alexander, the Director of NSA, who has also veriﬁed the application pursuant
to 28 U.S.C. § 1746 in lieu of an oath or afﬁrmation. E _pplication at 5, 18; 50
U.S.C. § 1842(b), (c)(1).

In other respects, however, the Court’s review of this application is not nearly so
straightforward. As a crucial threshold matter, there are substantial questions about whether
some aspects of the proposed collection are properly regarded as involving the use of PR/TT
devices. There are also noteworthy issues regarding the certiﬁcation of relevance pursuant to
Section l842(c)(2) and the speciﬁcations that the order must include under Section
1842(d)(2)(A), as well as post-acquisition concerns regarding the procedures for handling the

metadata. The Court’s resolution of these issues is set out below.
