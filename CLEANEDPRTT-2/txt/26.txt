 

(4) the term “trap and trace device” means a device or process which captures the
incoming electronic or other impulses which identify the originating number or
other dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information reasonably likely to
identify the source of a wire or electronic communication, provided, however, that
such information shall not include the contents of any communication.

These deﬁnitions employ three other terms — “electronic communication,” “wire
communication,” and “contents” — that are themselves governed by statutory deﬁnitions “set
forth for such terms in section 2510” of title 18. 18 U.S.C. § 3127(1). Section 2510 defines

these terms as follows:
(1) “Electronic communication” is defined as:

any transfer of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds, data, or intelligence of any
nature transmitted in whole or in part by a wire, radio, electromagnetic,
photoelectronic or photooptical system that affects interstate or foreign commerce,
but does not include — (A) any wire or oral communication. [25]

18 U.S.C. §2510(12).
(2) “Wire communication” is defined as:

any aural transfer made in whole or in part through the use of facilities for the
transmission of communications by the aid of wire, cable, or other like connection
between the point of origin and the point of reception . . . furnished or operated by
any person engaged in providing or operating such facilities for the transmission
of interstate or foreign communications or communications affecting interstate or
foreign commerce.

18 U.S.C. §2510(1).

 

25 The other exclusions to this definition at Section 2510(12)(B)—(D) are not relevant to
this case.
