Finally, and again subject to the
discussion below regarding what types of information may properly be acquired, the Court

concludes that the automated processes resulting in the transmission to NSA of information

 

28 Many of the communications for which information will be acquired will fall within
the broad deﬁnition of “electronic communication” at 18 U.S.C. § 2510(12). If, however, a
covered communication consists of an“aural transfer,” ii, “a transfer containing the human
voice at any point between and including the point of origin and the point of reception,” i_d_. §
2510(18), then it could constitute a “wire communication” under the meaning of Section
2510(1). In either case, the communications subject to collection are “wire or electronic
communication[s],” as required in Sections 3127(3) & (4).

29 The term “process,” as used in the deﬁnitions of “pen register” and “trap and trace
device”, has its “generally understood” meaning of “a series of actions or operations conducing
to an end” and “covers software and hardware operations used to collect information.” Inge
