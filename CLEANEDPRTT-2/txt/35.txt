With regard to “contents,” the Court is, of course, bound by the deﬁnition set forth in
Section 2510(8), which, as noted, covers “any information concerning the substance, purport, or
meaning” of the wire or electronic communication to which the information relates. When the
coMunication at issue is between or among end users, application of the deﬁnition of
“contents” can be relatively straightforward. For an e-mail communication, for example, the
contents would most obviously include the text of the message, the attachments, and the subj ect-
line information. In the context of person—to—computer communications like the interactions
between a user and a web—mail service provider, however, determining what constitutes contents
can become “hazy.” _S_e_e 2 LaFave, gtaL. Criminal Procedure § 4.6(b) at 476 (“[W]hen a person
sends a message to a machine, the meaning of ‘contents’ is unclear”). Particularly in the user-
to-provider context, the broad statutory definition of contents includes some information beyond

what might, in ordinary parlance, be considered the contents of a communication.
