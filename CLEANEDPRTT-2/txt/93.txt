 

event, however, that NSA encounters circumstances that it believes necessitate alteration of the
dissemination procedures that have been approved by the Court, the government may obtain
prospectively-applicable modiﬁcations to those requirements upon a determination by the Court
that such modiﬁcations are appropriate under the circumstances and in light of the sweeping and
non-targeted nature of the PR/TT collection. Q Stande Minimization Procedures for FBI
Electronic Surveillance and Physical Search § ID (on ﬁle with the Court in Docket No. 08-
1 83 3).

F. Retention

Under the _Drder, the PR/TT metadata was available for querying for
four and one—half years, after which it had to be destroyed. _Order at 13. The four-
and-one—half-year retention period was originally set based upon NSA’S assessment of how long
collected metadata is likely to have operational value. §e§_0pinion at 70—71.
Pursuant to the government’s proposal, the retention period would be extended to ﬁve years.
_Application at 13. The government asserts that the purpose of the change is to
“develop and maintain consistency” with the retention period for NSA’s bulk telephony metadata
collection, which is authorized by this Court under the FISA business records provision, 50
U.S.C. § 1861._Response at 24. The Court is satisﬁed that the relatively small
extension of the retention period that is sought by the government is justiﬁed by the

administrative beneﬁts that would result.
