§_e_e id; at 9, ll. Terrorist efforts to evade surveillance, in
combination with the inability to know the full range of ongoing terrorist activity at a given time,
make it “impossible to determine in advance what metadata will turn out to be valuable in
tracking, identifying, characterizing and exploiting a terrorist.” I_d. at 17-18. Analysts know that

Section 1861 in that it ro oses to capture metadata for a larger volume of US. person
communications. ﬁhResponse at 3. The Court is satisﬁed that the increase in
US. person communications does not undermine the basis for relevance, particularly in view of
the speciﬁc safeguards for accessing and disseminating US. person information.
