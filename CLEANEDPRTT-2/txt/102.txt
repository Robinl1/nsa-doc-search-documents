 

the language of Section 1809(a)(2) demonstrates that Congress intended at least some
unauthorized PR/TT acquisitions to be covered by the criminal prohibition. The statute expressly
reaches, among other things, information obtained through “electronic surveillance not
authorized by this chapter, [or] chapter 119, 121, or 206 of Title 18.” Section 1809 is part of
Chapter 36 of Title 50 of the US. Code. Chapter 36, in turn, encompasses all of FISA, as
codiﬁed in Title 50, including FISA’s PR/TT provisions found at 50 U.S.C. §§ 1841-1846.
Accordingly, “this chapter” in Section 1809(a)(2) refers in part to the FISA PR/TT provisions.
Moreover, Chapter 206 of Title 18, which is also referenced in Section 1809(a)(2), consists
exclusively of the PR/TT provisions of the criminal code, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3121-3127, key portions
of which are incorporated by reference into FISA. _S_ee 50 U.S.C. § 1841(2) (incorporating the
deﬁnitions of “pen register” and “trap and trace device” found at 18 U.S.C. § 3127). Because
Chapter 206 of Title 18 authorizes no means of acquiring information other than through the use
of PR/TT devices, Section 1809(a)(2)’s reference to “electronic surveillance” must be understood
to include at least some information acquired through the use of PR/TT authority.

That conclusion is reinforced by examination of FISA’s deﬁnition of “electronic
surveillance,” which applies to Section 1809, see 50 U.S.C. § 1801 (“As used in this
subchapter: . . .”), and which is broad enough to include some (but not necessarily all)

information acquired through the use of PR/TT devices.82 “Electronic surveillance” is deﬁned, in
