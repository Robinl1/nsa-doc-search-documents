 

37, the ordinary meanings of the terms “dialing,” “routing,” addressing,” and “signaling” — which
are not deﬁned by the statute — are relatively broad. Moreover, as noted above, the term
“contents” is broadly deﬁned to include “ﬂy information concerning the substance, purport, or
meaning of [an electronic] communication.” 18 U.S.C. § 2510(8) (emphasis added). And
“electronic communication,” too, is deﬁned broadly to mean “ﬂy transfer of signs, signals,
writing, images, sounds, data or intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by a
wire, radio, electromagnetic, photoelectronic, or photooptical system . . . .” 18 U.S.C. §
2510(12) (emphasis added).

Given the breadth of the terms used in the statute, it is not surprising that courts have
identiﬁed forms of information that constitute both DRAS and contents. In the context of
Internet communications, a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) ~ “an address that can lead you to

a ﬁle on any computer connected to the Internet”31 —

constitutes a form of “addressing
information” under the ordinary meaning of that term. Yet, in some circumstances a URL can
also include “contents” as deﬁned in Section 2510(8). In particular, if a user runs a search using
an Internet search engine, the “search phrase would appear in the URL after the ﬁrst forward
slash” as part of the addressing information, but would also reveal contents, _1._C_=, the “substance”
and ‘meaning’ of the communication . . . that the user is conducting a search for information on a

particular topic.” 11 re Application of the United States for an Order Authorizing the Use of a
