 

When it is not known, and there is no reason to know, that a piece of information was
acquired through electronic surveillance that was not authorized by the Court’s prior orders, the
information is not subject to the criminal prohibition in Section 1809(a)(2). Of course,
government ofﬁcials may not avoid the strictures of Section 1809(a)(2) by cultivating a state of
deliberate ignorance when reasonable inquiry would likely establish that information was indeed
obtained through unauthorized electronic surveillance. E, ggu, United States v. Whitehill, 532
F.3d 746, 751 (8th Cir.) (where “failure to investigate is equivalent to ‘burying one’s head in the
sand,’” willful blindness may constitute knowledge), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 610 (2008).
However, when it is not known, and there is genuinely no reason to know, that a piece of
information was acquired through electronic surveillance that was not authorized by the Court’s
prior orders, the information is not subject to the criminal prohibition in Section 1809(a)(2).

The Court is satisﬁed that neither Section 1809(a)(2) nor any other provision of law
precludes it from authorizing the government to access and use this category of information. The

bigger question here is whether the Court should grant such authority. Given NSA’s

 

longstanding and pervasive violations of the prior orders in this matter, the Court believes that it
would be acting well within its discretion in precluding the government from accessing or using
such information. Barring any use of the information would provide a strong incentive for the
exercise of greater care in this massive collection by the executive branch ofﬁcials responsible
for ensuring compliance with the Court’s orders and other applicable requirements. On the other

hand, the government has asserted that it has a strong national security interest in accessing and
