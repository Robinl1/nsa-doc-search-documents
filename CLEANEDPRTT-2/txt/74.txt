 

assessing relevance, the primary difference between the current application and prior bulk PR/TT
authorizations is that the current application encompasses a much larger volume of
communications, without limiting the requested authorization to streams of data with a relatively
high concentration of Foreign Power communications.60

There is precedent, however, for concluding that a wholly non-targeted bulk production
of metadata under Section 1861 can be relevant to international terrorism investigations. In those
cases, the FISC has found that the ongoing production by major telephone service providers of
call detail records for all domestic, United States-to-foreign, and foreign-to—United States calls, in
order to facilitate comparable forms of NSA analysis and with similar restrictions on handling

and dissemination, is relevant to investigations of the Foreign Powers. §_e_e, gg, Docket No. I

 

59 As part of the relevance analysis, the-Opinion also relied on the presence
of “safeguards” governing the handling and dissemination of the bulk metadata and information
derived from it. The safeguards proposed in the current application are discussed below, and, as
modiﬁed, the Court ﬁnds them to be adequate. §§§ Part IV, _i_nf_r_2_1.

6° The current application also seeks to expand the categories of metadata to be acquired
for each communication. The Court is satisfied that the categories of metadata described in the
current application constitute directly relevant information insofar as they relate to
communications of a Foreign Power. _S_e_e, gg,—Alexander Decl. at 19-22. The
metadata for other communications is relevant to the investigations of the Foreign Powers for the
reasons discussed herein.
