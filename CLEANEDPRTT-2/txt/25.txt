 

In the remainder of this Opinion, the Court will ﬁrst consider whether the proposed
collection involves the use of a PIUTT device within the meaning of the applicable statutory
deﬁnitions, and whether the data that the government seeks to collect consists of information that
may properly be acquired by such a device. Next, the Court will consider whether the
application satisﬁes the statutory relevance standard and contains all the necessary elements. The
Court will then address the procedures and restrictions proposed by the government for the
retention, use, and dissemination of the information that is collected. Finally, the Court will
consider the government’s request for permission to use all previously-collected data, including
information falling outside the scope of the Court’s prior authorizations.

II. The Proposed Collection, as Modiﬁed Herein, Involves the Installation and Use of PIUTT
Devices

A. The Applicable Statutory Deﬁnitions

For purposes of 50 U.S.C. §§ 1841-1846, FISA adopts the deﬁnitions of “pen register”
and “trap and trace device” set out in 18 U.S.C. § 3127. E 50 U.S.C. § 1841(2). Section 3127
provides the following deﬁnitions:

(3) the term “pen register” means a device or process which records or decodes

dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information transmitted by an instrument

or facility from which a wire or electronic communication is transmitted,

provided, however, that such information shall not include the contents of any
communication . . . ;[24]

 

24 The deﬁnition excludes any device or process used by communications providers or
customers for certain billing-related purposes or “for cost accounting or other like purposes in the
ordinary course of business.” § 3127(3). These exclusions are not pertinent to this case.
