 

G. Oversight

The government proposes to employ an internal oversight regime that closely tracks the
oversight provisions adopted by the Court in the—Order, requiring, among other
things, that NSA OGC and NSD take various steps to ensure that the data is collected and
handled in accordance with the scope of the authorization. Compare _ Order at 13-
16, with-Alexander Decl. at 29-30. There is, however, one signiﬁcant difference.
The _Order required NSA OGC to ensure that all NSA personnel permitted to
access the metadata or receive query results were ﬁrst “provided the appropriate and adequate
training and guidance regarding the procedures and restrictions for storage, access, and
dissemination of the PR/TT metadata and/or PR/TT metadata—derived information, i._e__., query
results.” _Order at 13-14. The analogous oversight provision in the government’s
current proposal, by contrast, directs NSA OGC and the Ofﬁce of the Director of Oversight and
Compliance (ODOC) to ensure that adequate training and guidance is provided to NSA personnel
having access to the metadata, but not to those receiving query results. &-
Alexander Decl. at 29. As discussed above, the government has proposed special rules and
restrictions on the handling and dissemination of query results. Most notably, PR/TT query
results must remain identiﬁable as bulk PR/TT—derived information, ﬂi_ Response
at 15, and may not be disseminated outside NSA Without the prior determination by a designated

ofﬁcial that any United States person information relates to counterterrorism information and that

it is necessary to understand the counterterrorism information or to assess its importance. -
