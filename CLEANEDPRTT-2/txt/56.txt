3’ CC

As noted above, “contents, when used with respect to any . . . electronic
communication, includes ﬂy information concerning the substance, purport, or meaning of that
communication.” 18 U.S.C. § 2510(8) (emphasis added). “Electronic communication” is also
deﬁned broadly, so that it encompasses the exchanges of information between account user and
provider that are described by communications actions. And of course, the deﬁnitions of “pen
register” and “trap and trace device” provide that the information acquired “shall not include the
contents of ﬂy communication,” Section 3127(3) & (4) (emphasis added) — unqualiﬁed language
that certainly seems to include electronic communications between account users and providers.
The combined literal effect of these provisions appears to be that PIUTT devices may not obtain
ﬂy information concerning the substance, purport, or meaning of ﬂy communication, including
those between account users and providers, and that communications actions that divulge ﬂy
such information would be impermissible “contents” for purposes of a PIVTT authorization.
The government does not directly confront the statutory text on this point. It does argue,
however, that an expansive, literal understanding of the prohibition on acquiring “contents”

would lead to an absurd and unintended restriction on what PIVTT devices can do. Speciﬁcally,

the government notes that the electronic impulses transmitted by dialing digits on a telephone
