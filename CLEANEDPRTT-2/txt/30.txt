 

resulting from-about communications is a form of “record[ing]” or “decod[ing]”

permissible under the deﬁnition of “pen register.”

C. The Requested Information

The application seeks to expand considerably the types of information authorized for
acquisition. Although the government provides new descriptions for the categories of
information sought, s_e_e_ -lexander Decl., Tab 2, they encompass all the types of
information that were actually collected (to include unauthorized collection) under color of the
prior orders. Memorandum of Law and Fact in Support of Application for Pen Registers and
Trap and Trace Devices for Foreign Intelligence Purposes (“Memorandum of Law”) at 3,

submitted as Exhibit B to the _Application.

1. The Proper Understanding of DRAS lnforrnation and Contents

The government contends that all of the data requested in this application may properly
be collected by a PR/TT device because all of it is dialing, routing, addressing or signaling
(“DRAS”) information, and none constitutes contents. 1d, at 22. In support of that contention,
the government advances several propositions concerning the meaning of “dialing, routing,
addressing, or signaling information” and “contents,” as those terms are used in the deﬁnitions of
“pen register” and “trap and trace device.” While it is not necessary to address all of the
government’s assertions, a brief discussion of the government’s proposed statutory construction
will be useful in explaining the Court’s decision to approve most, but not all, of the proposed

collection.
