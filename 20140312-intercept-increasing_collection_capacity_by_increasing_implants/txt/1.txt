{Sf/SI) Building the operations floor and increasing the number of break-out rooms will enable us to grow From the current average of 20-25 of these
operations per day to over IOO per day and will facilitate the integration ofNSAfCSS computer network operations and real-time customer support. Sustained
collection involving automated implants pushing collected data from targets to the ROC as well as voice and geolocation collection are managed from the
Operations Teaming Areas. The increased capacity in this area will support a growth from managing an average of IOU-150 active implants today to
simultaneously managing thousands ofimplantcd targets. The increased personnel capacity will support this net growth in operations tempo and will allow

the integration ofTAO's Requirements 8: Targeting Division alongside the ROC's operators in order to better synchronize target development and efficiently
plan and execute endpoint operations.
