development based on contact chaining techniques. In this regard it is extremely difficult
to envision it playing that role at NSA. PROTON requires a NOFORNIORCON access,
must be licensed, has no API that would allow access integration with other tools (E.G.
Federated query) and, represents a significant funding investment and dependency on a
CIA contractor.

RECOMMENDED RESPONSE: (SKINF) In the context of the atmosphere
created by the events of 09” liOl and the following investigations into the perceived
‘intelligence failure’ a recurring theme has been the lack of data sharing on the part of the
IC members. Against that background, it is difficult to deny requested access to SIGINT-
only datasets that are thought to have value to other intelligence analystsimissions. In an
effort to:

a.) provide access to the requested data and,

b.) break new ground in the information sharing arena while,

c.) not moving any more data out of NSA and into duplicative storage.
We propose to utilize the 1C shared information space ICSIS on INTELINK and
implement IC access to our GLOBALREACH federated query service via accounts
and access verified by PKI certificates. This service will provide the access requested and
permit the auditing legally required of NSA. Further, we request that CIA forward
PROTON data from non-SIGINT sources to NSA for inclusion in the dataset searched by
GLOBALREACH. For data that must remain in HCS channels, we will create an HCS
partition in FASCIA II. This will permit one-stop access to contact information for IC
analysts. We believe that we can have GLOBALREACH available in the ICSIS shared
space by ()1 Oct 2005.

RECOMMENDATION: (FOUO) That you sign the enclosed note to the Office
of the Director, National Intelligence. Questions ofa legal nature should be directed to
