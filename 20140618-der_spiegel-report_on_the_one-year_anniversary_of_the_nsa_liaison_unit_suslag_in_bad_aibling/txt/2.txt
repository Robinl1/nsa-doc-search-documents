[SHED In April; the Special US Liaison Activity Germany [SUSLAG] celebrated one
year in their purpose-built facility on the German Ministry of Defense facility
Mangfall Kaserne in Bad Aiblingy Germany. SUSLAG [formerly known as Combined
Group Germany} was compelled to find a new home by the closure of its previous
host; Bad Aibling Station.

[SHSI] Thanks to the combined efforts of the Bad Aibling Transition Team; the
Technical Support Program Management Office; Eundesnachrichtendienst (END;
the German intelligence service and our German partner}; the European Technical
Center [ETC]; ITDJ NCEURJ 1&L‘H‘J and others too numerous to mention, the
building was completed in just 4V2 months; from groundbreaking to move-in; all
during the depths ofwinter. [SUSLAG's END colleagues affectionately refer to the
new SUSLAG building as "Die Elechdose'" or "the Tin CanﬂI owing to its difference
in appearance from the other buildings on Mangfall Kaserne it has no windows, is
made of metal and is shelter-like in appearance]. SUSLAG went off NSANET at Bad
Aibling Station on Friday; 3 April 2004; and reappeared on NSANET in the new
facility on the following Monday; thanks to an outstanding team of IT professionals
working through the weekend.

[SHSI] In addition to SUSLAG's long-standing role as liaison to the German
intelligence service; .it is parent to two exciting joint ventures, the joint
Analysis Center {JAC} and the joint SIGINT Activity LISA}. The Joint Analysis
Center [IACJI comprises five NSA civilian analysts who are integrated into the
END

    

[SHSI] JSAJ the JAC's younger sibling; was declared operational last year and
continues to build toward full operating capability which is expected by the end of
2005. The JSA is the outcome of an agreement between the Director; NBA; and the
President of the END to launch a strategic cooperation initiative in the mutual
pursuit of intelligence related to counterterrorist counterproliferationy and other
transnational targets.

[SHSI] With the establishment of a US-only communications center in the new
SUSLAG facility; it became possible to provide secure connectivity forJSAJ piggy.-
backing on SUSLAG's connection to ETC; at which point the JSA comms pass
through ETC's Third-Party guard device subsystem onto NSANET. This provided for
the first time an electronic connection from NSA to JSA for tasking to flow in one
direction; and SIGINT in the other. JSA is primarily a SIGDEV asset from NSA's
point ofview but is an essential component of END's collection architecture. JSA is
