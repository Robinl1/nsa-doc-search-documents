(U//FOUO) This document establishes information security guidelines on NSA/CSS-sponsored
research in the ﬁeld of quantum computing (QC). The objectives deﬁning the scope of this
research activity are:

l) (S/fREL) To assess if it is to NSA’s beneﬁt to continue research into whether
practical-scale QC can be developed within a reasonable timeframe, to identify its most
promising physical embodiment(s), and to formulate a credible scenario for its large-scale
development;

2) (U//FOUO) To gain an understanding of the computational cryptanalytic capabilities
of quantum computers; and

3) (U//FOUO) To identify practical cryptographic methods that are not susceptible to
quantum computational attack.

(S//REL) These guidelines do not cover the possibility of large-scale cryptologic QC
development programs at NSA, but only the research and planning preliminary to, and in
possible support of, such programs.

(S//SI//REL) Much of the research in quantum computing is still very basic and is most
effectively pursued in NSA-funded open research programs. These programs play a critical role
as the major source of new ideas and for training future researchers in the ﬁeld. However, NSA
is pursuing more than just basic, unclassiﬁed research. NSA is also attempting to preserve the
SIGINT potential of quantum computing (i.e., the cryptanalytic applications of QC) while
simultaneously attempting to protect the information security of both the Government and
private sectors against hostile QC attacks (i.e., the cryptographic, mission assurance applications
of QC of interest to the Information Assurance community). These goals must be pursued at the
classiﬁed level.

(U//FOUO) There are several fundamental reasons for classifying QC research:
1) (TS//SI//REL) To protect NSA’s efforts to develop cryptanalytic QC to attack high-

grade public key encryption systems by denying adversaries information concerning
NSA’s assessment of, and/or plans for, large-scale QC development;
