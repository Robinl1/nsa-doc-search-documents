(U) DEFINITIONS

(U) Cryptanalysis - The study of breaking codes and ciphers.

(S//SI//REL) Cryptanalytic—Scale - (as applied to quantum computers) Large enough to perform
computations of actual cryptanalytic importance to NSA. A more speciﬁc deﬁnition is likely to
be compartmented, and will change over time.

(U) Cryptography - The principles, means, and methods for rendering plain information
unintelligible to the uninitiated and for restoring encrypted information to intelligible form.

(U) Cryptology - The art and science of making codes/ciphers and breaking them,. Cryptology
breaks out into two disciplines: cryptography (making or using codes/ciphers) and cryptanalysis

(breaking codes/ciphers).

(U) Detailed engineering design - Speciﬁcations of a set of qubits and the associated
initialization, control, and measurement hardware and software at a level of detail commensurate
with the requirements of industrial fabrication.

(U) Fidelity - Precision of qubit operations such as initialization, logic gates, and readout.
