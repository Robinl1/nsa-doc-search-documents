2) (S/fREL) To enable us to track our adversaries’ degree of success or failure in similar
QC development efforts; and

3) (U//FOUO) To protect our own systems against adversarial cryptanalytic QC efforts.

(S//REL) Based on this, the distinctions between unclassiﬁed and classiﬁed information
contained in this guide attempt to differentiate between unclassiﬁed basic-level, academic-scale
research of scientiﬁc interest, and more comprehensive classiﬁed research which might disclose
techniques that may otherwise be possible to protect, or which might imply, rightly or wrongly,
serious intent on NSA’s part to pursue large-scale development of cryptanalytic quantum

computers.
