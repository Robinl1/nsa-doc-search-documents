(U/lFOUO) Figure 4b: During 1QCY12, NSAW SID reported an increase of 9% of roamer incidents under
all FISA Authorities. There was also a 260% increase in database query FISA Authority incidents during
1QCY12. Human Error accounted for the majority of all FISA Authorities database query incidents (74%).

(U/lFOUO) Roamers: Roaming incidents occur when valid foreign target selector(s) are active in the U.S.
Roamer incidents continue to constitute the largest category of collection incidents across E.O. 12333 and FAA
authorities. Roamer incidents are largely unpreventable, even with good target awareness and traffic review,
since target travel activities are often unannounced and not easily predicted.

(SI/SI/INF) Other Inadvertent Collection: Other inadvertent collection incidents account for situations
where targets were believed to be foreign but who later turn out to be U.S. persons and other incidents that do
not fit into the previously identified categories.

(TS/lSI/IREL TO USA, FVEY) Database Queries: During 1QCY12, NSAW SID reported a total of 115
database query incidents across all Authorities, representing a 53% increase from 4QCY11. E.O. 12333
Authority database query incidents accounted for 84% (97) of the total, and all FISA Authorities database query
incidents accounted for 16% (18).

(U/lFOUO) Figure 5 illustrates the most common root causes for incidents involving database queries as
determined by SV.

0 99% (114) of the 1QCY12 database query incidents are attributed to Operator Error as the root
cause, and involved:
0 Human error (85) which encompassed:
I Broad syntax (i.e., no or insufficient limiters / defeats / parameters) (55);
Typographical error (17);
Boolean operator error (6);
Query technique understood but not applied (4);
Not familiar enough with the tool used for query (2); and
