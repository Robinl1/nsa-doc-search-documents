(TS/lSI/IREL TO USA, FVEY) As depicted in Figures 3a and 3b, of the 19 delayed detasking FISA
incidents, 15 (79%) resulted from a failure to detask all selectors, 2 (11%) resulted from analyst not detasking
when required, 1 (5%) resulted from partner agency error, and 1 (5%) resulted from all tasking not terminated
(e.g., dual route).

b. N SAW SID-reported Collection Incidents by Sub-Type and Authority

(U//FOUO) Figures 4a-b depicts NSAW SID-reported collection incidents by Authority (E.O. 12333 and
all FISA Authorities), and identiﬁes the primary sub-types for those incidents. An explanation of the more
prominent collection incident sub-types follows the graphs.

(U/lFOUO) Figure 4a: During 1QCY12, NSAW SID reported a 39% increase of database query incidents
under E.O. 12333 Authority. Human Error accounted for 74% of E.O.12333 database query incidents.

(TS/lSI/IREL TO USA, FVEY) International Transit Switch Collection*: International Transit switches,
FAIRVIEW (US-990), ST ORMBREW (US-983), ORANGEBLOSSOM (US-3251), and SILVERZEPHYR
(US-3273), are Special Source Operations (SSO) programs authorized to collect cable transit traffic passing
through U.S. gateways with both ends of the communication being foreign. When collection occurs with one or
both communicants inside the US, this constitutes inadvertent collection. From 4QCY11 to 1QCY12, there was an
increase of transit program incidents submitted from 7 to 27, due to the change in our methodology for reporting and
counting of these types of incidents. (*See Annex G in SID’s 1QCY12 IO Quarterly Report for additional details
regarding these incidents.)
