0 Lack of due diligence (i.e., failure to follow standard operating procedure) (13)
0 Training and guidance (i.e., training issues) (9); and
0 Resources (i.e., inaccurate or insufficient research information and/or workload issues) (7).

(U/lFOUO) The remaining 1 database query incident can be attributed to System Error as the root cause
and occurred due to a mechanical error with the tool.

(U/lFOUO) Analysis identified that the number of database query incidents could be reduced if analysts
more consistently applied rules/standard operating procedures (SOPs) for conducting queries.

(S//SI//NF) Auditors continue to play an important role in the discovery of database query incidents,
identifying 70 (61%) of the 115 reported database query incidents.

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Of the 115 database query incidents reported for 1QCY12, Figure 6 identifies
the database involved and the associated percentage of the total. Databases considered to be Source Systems of
Record (SSR) have been labeled as such.

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Note that the total number of databases involved in the database query

incidents in Figure 6 does not equal the number of database query incidents reﬂected in Figure 5 or in the
1QCY12 SID IO Quarterly Report because a database query incident may occur in more than one database.
