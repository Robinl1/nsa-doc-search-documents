(TS/lSI/IREL TO USA, FVEY) Figures la-b compares all categories of NSAW SID-reported incidents
(collection, dissemination, unauthorized access, and retention) by Authority for 2QCY11 — 1QCY12. From
4QCY11 to 1QCY12, there was an overall increase in incidents of 11%. There was also an increase of 11% for
both E.O. 12333 and FISA incidents. The increase in incidents reported for 1QCY12 was due to an increase in
the number of reported Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) roamer1 incidents, which may be
attributed to an increase in Chinese travel to visit friends and family for the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday.
