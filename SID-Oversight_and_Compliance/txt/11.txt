0 Human error (i.e., selector mistypes, incorrect realm, or improper query) (71);
0 Lack of due diligence (i.e., failure to follow standard operating procedures) (68); and
0 Training and guidance (i.e., training issues) (9).

(U/lFOUO) Analysis found that analysts could reduce the number of incidents if there was more
comprehensive research information available at the time of tasking as well as through better use of defeats,
more careful review of data entry to avoid typographical errors and omissions, and by following SOPs more
consistently.

(U/lFOUO) 70% of the S2-reported incidents during 1QCY12 are attributed to system issues as the root
cause, and involved:
0 System limitations (i.e., system lacks the capability to ‘push’ real-time travel data out to analysts,
system/device unable to detect changes in user) (541); and
0 System engineering (i.e., data tagging, configuration, design ﬂaws, etc.) (1).

(TS/lSI/IREL TO USA, FVEY) System Limitations, the largest percentage of System Error root cause, can
be attributed to situations where a valid foreign target is found roaming in the United States without indication
in raw traffic.

(TS/lSI/lNF) Business Record (BR) FISA. As of 16 February 2012, NSA determined that approximately
3,032 files containing call detail records potentially collected pursuant to prior BR Orders were retained on a
server and been collected more than five years ago in violation of the 5-year retention period established for
BR collection. Specifically, these ﬁles were retained on a server used by technical personnel working with
the Business Records metadata to maintain documentation of provider feed data formats and performed

background analysis to document why certain contain chaining rules were created. In addition to the BR
