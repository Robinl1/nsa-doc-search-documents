-€FS#SWNF—) BR Orders allow NSA to obtain telephony

‘ metadata from US telecommunication companies,
compelled to do so under a court order. This FlSA
Order requires specified telecommunication providers
to share business records in the form of telephony
metadata with the US government.

 

"What are BR Orders?"

WThe BR FISA authority is for collection of
tangible things gathered to protect the United States
against international terrorism. BR Orders are
renewed approximately every 60-90 days. We will refer

official named in the Order) prior to querying the
authorized repositories.

  

—(—'lZS#Sl#NF-)- NSA can use identifiers, after they have
been approved for RAS, to query the BR metadata for
counterterrorism threats to the homeland. The BR

Court Order onl authorizes contact chaining and
dueries within the metadata.
