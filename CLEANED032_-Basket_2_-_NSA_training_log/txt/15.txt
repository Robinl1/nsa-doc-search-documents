“Reasonable Articutabte Sasptcmn standard?"

-(-'FS+I-Sl#N-F)- You Will recall from Lesson
One that the BR FlSA Order is authorized
because the FISC recognizes there is a
counterterrorism interest in obtaining those
business records. However, because NSA
is receiving a great deal of US person
telephony records, we have strict
guidelines on when NSA can access the
metadata under this authority. One of the
requirements is that in order to access the
metadata, NSA must establish RAS on
each selector prior to querying the BR
FlSA repositories.

-€FS#Sl#NF-)-The BR FISC Order states
that NSA may query speciﬁc identiﬁers
_that satisfy the RAS standard for
purposes of obtaining counterterrorism
intelligence.

—€FS#Sl#N-F)-ln order to assist in
determining when a selector has satisﬁed
the RAS standard, the Ofﬁce of General
Counsel (OGC) has issued a RAS Memo
to help Signals intelligence Directorate
(SID) personnel make RAS determinations
on telephone identiﬁers. The memo
contains guidelines that apply to both the
BR and Pen Register and Trap and Trace
(PRfl’T) FlSA Orders.
