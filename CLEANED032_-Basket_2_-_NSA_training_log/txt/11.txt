Associations to establish a RAS nomination

Reasonable Articulable Suspicion (RAS) standard — requires that an NSA analyst
must be able to point to a single fact that points to the fact that a selector may be
associated with a terrorist group listed in the F ISC Order before we are
authorized to conduct analysis on it.

RAS determination — should cause a reasonable person to suspect that the
identifier is associated with one of the terrorist organizations named in the Order.

 

WRecall that the BR FlSC

Order allows NSA to obtain an
immense amount of foreign and US
metadata contained in the Business
Records. The FlSC Order contains
strict guidelines on when this metadata ‘
is allowed to be accessed and when it a
is not. It must be associated with
specific terrorist organizations named
in the Order. It also must meet a
standard that is referred to as the
Reasonable Articulable Suspicion
(RAS) Standard. In a nutshell, the
RAS standard requires that an NSA
analyst must be able to point to a_
single fact that points to the fact that a
seed/telephone selector may be
associated with a terrorist group listed
n the FlSC Order before we are
authorized to conduct analysis on it.

WW6 Will address the RAS

standard in detail in the next lesson,
but for now, understand that the fact or
facts which make up a RAS
determination should cause a
reasonable person to suspect that the
identifier is associated with one of the
terrorist organizations named in the
Order.
