The Optic Nerve documentation shows legalities were being considered as new capabilities were being
developed. Discussing adding automated facial matching, for example, analysts agreed to test a system
before firming up its legal status for everyday use.

"It was agreed that the legalities of such a capability would be considered once it had been developed, but
that the general principle applied would be that if the accuracy of the algorithm was such that it was useful to
the analyst (ie, the number of spurious results was low, then it was likely to be proportionate)," the 2008
document reads.

The document continues: "This is allowed for research purposes but at the point where the results are
shown to analysts for operational use, the proportionality and legality questions must be more carefully
considered."
