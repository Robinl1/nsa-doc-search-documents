x86 assembly. This work will involve interacting with the ﬁrmware
implant as well as the code that IMBIOS bootstraps (SIERRAMIST).

o (TS/ISI/IREL) Add support for the SSD to WICKEDVICAR.
WICKEDVICAR is the remote tool used to perform remote survey and
installation. This code is C++ and will involve interacting with the
ﬁrmware implant from a Windows OS.

- (TS/ISI/IREL) Add the SSD vendor support to the IRATEMONK ﬁrmware
and implant database tool. This code is mostly python code that
interacts with a drive via a Linux driver.

(TS/lSI/IREL) The SSD support for IRATEMONK project currently offers the
greatest variety of new work that an intern might be able to do.

[edit] (TS/lSI/IREL) Covert Storage Product

(TS/ISI/IREL) Create a covert storage product that is enabled from a hard
drive ﬁrmware modiﬁcation. The idea would be to modify the ﬁrmware of a
particular hard drive so that it normally only recognizes say half of its
available space. It would report this size back to the operating system and
not provide any way to access the additional space. The ﬁrmware would have
a special hook inside of it that on receipt of some custom ATA command, it
would "unlock" the rest of the drive on the next boot of the drive. When
covert storage is locked, only 1 partition would be present on the drive.
When unlocked, the ﬁrmware would ﬁx up the partition table to account for
the second hidden partition whose space is now available on the drive. When
ﬁnished with covert storage, a special command can be sent back to the
drive that will lock the drive again. On the next boot, the ﬁrmware will hide
the extra space and ﬁx up the partition table so only 1 partition exists.

[edit] (Ul/FOUO) SADDLEBACK

(TS/ISI/IREL) Utilizing a hard drive's serial port, create a ﬁrmware implant
that has the ability to pass to and from an implant running in the operating
system. In practice, the serial port will be connected to a short hop radio that
can communicate with another radio in a system. Doing a ﬁrmware
modiﬁcation eliminates the need to tap the SATA bus as was done on other
versions of SADDLE BACK. Performing ﬁrmware modiﬁcation will allow for a
smaller SADDLEBACK in the form of a laptop drive as opposed to the current
version which only comes in a a 3.5 inch version.

[edit] (U/IFOUO) ALTEREDCARBON Support

(TS/lSI/IREL) Develop IRATEMONK implants for the newest Seagate drives
including their hybrid drive products. This work will primarily be a reverse

engineering effort, but if successful will require updates to both IMBIOS (x86
code, C and assembly), WICKEDVICAR (x86, C++), and SPITEFULANGEL
