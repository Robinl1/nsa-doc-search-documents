hard drive implants into server spaces which provide increased covert
storage and the capability to keep persistence logs which currently aren't
available on BIOS only techniques.

[edit] (Ul/FOUO) Enhancment of testing
capabilities

(TS/lSI/IREL) IRATEMONK makes use of ROGUE SAMURAI and actual
hardware to perform its testing. The downside of testing with actual
hardware is that testing takes many hours/days to complete. Someone with
the right level of test development experience can help to improve the
current IRATE MONK testing strategy.

[edit] (TS/lSI/IREL) Self-Encrypting-Drive
(SED) Persistence

(TS/lSI/lREL) SED drives provide additional security measures which often
thwart IRATE MONK developer efforts to modify the ﬁrmware on these
drives. I highly skilled intern with reverse engineering skills and
understanding of security in computing systems would be invaluable in
tackling one of the persistence divisions more difﬁcult problems.

[edit] (TS/lSI/lREL) OS Execution

(TS/lSI/lREL) While a lot of work in the Persistence Division involves
modifying ﬁrmware, there is still a large need for OS kernel and user—mode
expertise. The ﬁrmware modiﬁcation done at the lowest levels of hardware
needs a way to obtain execution inside of a running OS so that a DNT
payload can be either given execution or installed.

[edit] (Ul/FOUO) CASTLECRASHER

(TS/lSI/IREL) CASTLECRASHER is the primary technique used in executing
DNT Windows payloads from all payload persistence techniques (i.e.
IRATEMONK and SIERRAMISTFREE). It is all Windows native mode code
built using Visual Studio. CASTLECRASHER has many advanced techniques
in it including thread injection and anti—stack backtracing. In many cases,
CASTLECRASHER is closer to the DNT style kernel work than it is to
traditional Persistence work. While the current version is quite robust, there
are several features that need to be added:

0 (TSI/SI/IREL) Currently, CASTLECRASHER doesn't work against
systems with 360 Safe installed. We need to ﬁnd a way around this even
if it involves using the older Windows service method of execution. This
