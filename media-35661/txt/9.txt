[edit] (TS/lSI/IREL) File System Support

(TS/ISI/IREL) The following ﬁle systems need support by
SIERRAMIST/JUMPDOLLAR:

[edit] (TS/lSI/IREL) BTRFS
(TS/lSI/IREL) This ﬁle system is slated to become the default in Fedora Core
17 or 18. Work can begin on supporting this now, however. This is applicable

primarily for JUMPDOLLAR, but maybe SIERRAMIST as well.

[edit] (TS/lSI/IREL) LVM

 

(TS/ISI/IREL) Back port changes of the LVM code in JUMPDOLLAR'S EXT4
FSM to SIERRAMIST'S EXT3.

[edit] (U/IFOUO) BERSERKR

(TS/lSI/IREL) BERSERKR is a persistent backdoor that is implanted into the
BIOS and runs from SMM. Although the core of the code is stable, there are
always new requirements against which to develop. This includes new
network interface card parasitic drivers as well as applications.

(TS/lSI/IREL) Some notable applications that need development:

- (TS/lSI/IREL) KIRKBOMB — Windows kernel examination to detect
loaded drivers, running processes as well. There is a prototype which
works on Windows 7, this needs to work on XP and 2008 including
64—bit systems.

- (TS/ISI/IREL) SODAPRESSED — Linux application persistence. Given a
running installation of Linux, install some application or inject
something into memory which will. This currently works on certain
versions of Linux without SELinux enabled.

(TS/lSI/IREL) There may also be requirements in the near future for:
