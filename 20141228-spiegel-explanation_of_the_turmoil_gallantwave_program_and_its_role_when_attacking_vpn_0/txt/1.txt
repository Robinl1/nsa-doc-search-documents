GALLANTWAVE Detailed Description

(TSJJSIHREL) GALLANTWAVE (GW) implementsTML Stage 1 PPF graphs (1 per host) with dedicated instances of lhe TechPrcmcte (GWAeg) and the PSPSeg (GWSeg). GW PPF graphsidentily and promote DNSC packets that
meet criteria speciﬁed in a Rules.cfg ﬁle. ATE GALLANTWAVE graph subsequenlly sessionizes the selected trafﬁc. injects controlrllow metadata, and forwards largeted DNSC Sessions lo a GW missionrapplication hosted on a
CA Server. The GWCAServer interacts wilh SCARLET FBIER (a CES LDNGHAULcomponent) to transform lhose sessions for IPraddresses within an approved set of target IPraddresses.The GWVCAServer transformed sessions
are sent to XKEYSCDRE via a modiﬁed TURMOIL XKSVSESSIDNS graph for session processing. strongrseleclion, and forwarding to folloonn processing systems and Corporate Repositories.
