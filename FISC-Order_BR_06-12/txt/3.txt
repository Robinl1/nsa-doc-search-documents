3. There are reasonable grounds to believe that the
tangible things sought are relevant to authorized investigations
(other than threat assessments) being conducted by the FBI under
guidelines approved by the Attorney General under Executive
Order 12333 to protect against international terrorism, which
investigations are not being conducted solely upon the basis of
activities protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution
of the United States. [50 U.S.C. § 1861(C)(l)]

4. The tangible things sought could be obtained with a
subpoena duces tecum issued by a court of the United States in
aid of a grand jury investigation or with‘any other order issued
by a court of the United States directing the production of
records or tangible things. [50 U.S.C. § 1861(c)(2)(D}3

WHEREFORE, the Court finds that the application of the
United States to obtain the tangible things, as described in the
application, satisfies the requirements of the Act and,
therefore,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, pursuant to the authority conferred
on this Court by the Act, that the application is GRANTED, and
it is

FURTHER ORDERED, as follows:
