Dear Dr. Tynan,

We received your mail sent to CEO Ohâ€”Hyun Kwon regarding the questions on our
handsets' technical function when powered off.

In brief, without the power source it is not possible to transmit any signal, due to
the components being inactive.
Thus the powered off devices are not able to be tracked or monitored by any 3rd

party.

The device in the article you mentioned isn't actually powered off but it contains
spyware which mimics the status of the battery being fully drained (such as turning
off the LCD screen on the device). While this could mislead the user to think the
device is powered down, the device still being tracked or monitored by leaving the
transceivers active.

Please see below our responses to your questions.

1. When the user requests any of your handsets to be powered off, what
components, if any remain activ i.e. consuming power?
=> No component can remain active after powering off.

a. If some components do remain active, what is the power source for these
components i.e. capacitor, battery or power transmitted from an external
source?
=> There is only one power source : battery.

A device can't be activated without battery even though TA(TraveI Adapter)
is connected.
