The Snowden Files: British Spies Used Sex and 'Dirty Tricks’
Slideshow No. l

GCHQ, the British signals intelligence agency, prepared the
following slides for a top-secret spy conference in 2012, describing
cyber operations. The slides focus on the efforts of a unit, the Joint
Intelligence Threat Research Group, or J TRIG. According to the
documents, JTRIG conducts ”honey traps,” sends adversaries
computer viruses, deletes their online presence, and employs
several other tactics. Documents previously published by NBC
News showed J TRIG engaged in cyber attacks on the hacktivist
collective known as Anonymous.

The slides were leaked by former NSA ontractor Edward Snowden
and obtained exclusively by NBC News. NBC News is publishing

the documents with minimal redactions to protect individuals. The

presenters notes for the slideshow are included.
