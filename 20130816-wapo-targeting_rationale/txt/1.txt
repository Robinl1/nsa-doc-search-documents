Targeting Rationale (TAR)

(Cl/SWREL TO USA, FVE Y) The basic premise of this process is to memorialize why you the
analyst have requested targeting- This rationale will be provided to 0m external FISA
Amendment Act (FAA) overseers, the Department of Justice and Ofﬁce of the Director of
National Intelligence, for all FAA targeting.

(SKISII/REL TO USA, FVE Y) While we do want to provide our FAA overseers with the
information they need, we DO NOT want to give them any extraneous information. Please
follow these instructions carefully to place a “Targeting Rationale” in the Target Information
Comments field in UTT and the Selector Comments ﬁeld in Octave (Note: There are additional
instructions below concerning issues with Octave). This rationale can be no longer than one
short sentence. Please see the screen captures below for proper placement.

(U/IFOUO) The TAR must be in the following format: MTAR: Targeting Rationale (TAR)
sentence!” (Note: The “TAR: ” and leading and trailing triple slashes are critical.)

(U/XFOUO) Targeting Requests will be sent back to draft when the TAR is not present or does
not meet the below criteria. Please contact your FAA Product. Line Lead for help as needed.

(Sf/SU/REL TO USA, FVEY) The essential elements ofinformation needed in the targeting
rationale are: “User” of the selector, link between the user and the foreign intelligence purpose,
and the foreign intelligence purpose. Avord the use of acronyms when possible, when used they
must be expanded.

(Cf/Sl/lREL TO USA, FVE Y) Your rationale MUST NOT contain any additional information
including: probable cause-like information (i.e. proof of yoru' analytic judgment), how you came
to your analytic conclusions, any RAGTIME information, classiﬁcation marking, or selector
information.

(TS/fSI/fNF) Below are some actual examples (please use the term “User” or “Selector” not your
target’s name). Analysts should consult their FAA Product Line Lead for questions concerning
TAR construction.
