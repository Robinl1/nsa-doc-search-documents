(TSHSIHREL) Happy Friday my esteemed and valued Intelligence Community colleagueslThere has been a topic of conversation that has started to rumble beneath the
surface ofthe Cyber-scene lately, it's about router hackingtforthis post. I'm not talking about your home ADSL router. I'm talking about bigger routers. such as Ciscosl'Junipers
lHuaweis used by ISPs fortheir infrastructure). Hacking routers has been good business for us and our S-eyes partners for some time now, but it is becoming more apparent
that other nation states are honing their skillzandjoining the scene. Before I get into ittoo much, let's go over some ofthe things that someone could do ifthey hack a router:

* You could add credentials. allowing yourselfto log in anytime you choose

* You could addlchange routing rules

* You could set up a packet capture capability...imagine running Wireshark on an ISP's infrastructure router...|ike a local listening postfor any credentials being passed overthe
wiret!)

* You could weaken any VPN encryption capabilities on the router, forcing it to create easily decryptable tunnels

* You could install a dorked version ofthe Operating System with whatever functionality you want pre-built in
