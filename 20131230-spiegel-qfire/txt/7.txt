= (TS//S|//REL) Extremely powerful CNE/CND/CNA network
effects are enabled by integrating our passive and active systems:
a Resetting connections (OUANTUMSKY)
= Redirecting targets for exploitation (OUANTUMINSERT)
= Taking control of IRC bots (OUANTUMBOT)
= Corrupting ﬁie uploads/downloads (OUANTUMCOPPER)

= (TS/ISII/REL) QUANTUMTHEORY dynamically injects packets into a
target's network session to achieve CNE/CND/CNA network effects.
= Retest: TURMOIL passive sensors detect target traffic & tip TURBINE command/control.
= gage: TURBINE mission logic constructs response & forwards to TAO node.
W Iniect: TAO node injects response onto Internet towards target.

=' (TS/ISIIIREL) The propagation delay from tip-to—target determines the
success rate of the network effect. Less Latency = More Success!
