APEX VPN Phases

      
 

 

â€˜7';-

> VPN Phase 1: IKE Metadata Only (Spin 15)

I IKE packets are exfiled to TURMOIL APEX.
I APEX reconstructs/reinjects IKE packets to the TURMOIL VPN components.

I TURMOIL VPN extracts metadata from each key exchange and sends to the
CES TOYGRIPPE metadata database. This database IS used by SIGDEV

analysts to identify potential targets for further exploitation.

> VPN Phase 2: Targeted IKE FonNarding (Spin 15)
I TURMOIL VPN looks up IKE packet IP addresses in KEYCARD.

I If either IP address is targeted, the key exchange ackets are forwarded to
the CES Attack Orchestrator (POISON NUT) for PN key recovery.

> VPN Phase 3: Static Tasking of ESP
I HAMMERSTEIN receives static tasking to exfil targeted ESP packets.
I APEX reconstructs/reinjects ESP packets to the TURMOIL VPN components.

I TURMOIL VPN requests VPN key from CES and attempts decryption.

> VPN Phase 4: Dynamic Targeting of ESP

I Based on the value returned by KEYCARD, the ESP for a particular VPN may

be targeted as well.
I TURMOIL sends to HAMMERSTEIN Wa TURBINE) the parameters for
capturing the ESP for the targeted VP .
