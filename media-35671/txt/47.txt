> C&C Phase 1: Manual Configuration (Spin 15)

I HAMMERMILL is configured via existing command interface.
I Simultaneously TURMOIL APEX is provided a configuration file for this HAMMERMILL mission.
I A human is responsible for keeping the two in sync.

I C&C Phase 2: Semi-automatic Configuration

I TURBINE receives mission parameters and automatically configures both the HAMMERMILL
Implant and the TURMOIL APEX components.

I TURBINE-HAMMERMILL interface uses CHIMNEYPOOL RPC commands and requires
HAMMERMILL verSIon 2.5.

' TURBINE-TURMOIL interface uses ISLANDTRANSPORT.

I C&C Phase 3: Dynamic Targeting
TURBINE sets initial configuration as in Phase 2.
I Exfiled traffic is evaluated by TURMOIL components+KEYCARD for selection decisions.
I TURMOIL messages to TURBINE to dynamically target a particular flow through the implant.
I Exam Ie:
° TpURMOIL receives an IKE key exchange (and possibly a few initial packets)
° TURMOIL evaluates the IP addresses to decide if the VPN being set up corresponds to a target
I If so, TURMOIL message to HAMMERMILL via TURBINE to capture/exfil corresponding ESP traffic.

I This Bhase must be mana ed so that router exfiI does not exceed the tolerable bandwidth limits set
by Q SEC and operationa concerns. TURBINE may need to Implement additional workflows to
monitor and control exfII volume.
