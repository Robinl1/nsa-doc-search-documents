Look for SA packets:
1) at destIP/destPort; protocoI=UDP,
2) that are at least 344 bytes long, and
3) whose first 128-bytes of Transport Payload “look random”.
(Easy/quick initial checks)
1. RSA Decrypt INF-HDR w/ Infrastructure Private Key.
- Authenticate w/ SHA-l

!“

- (Slow secondary check; can’t withstand much non-SA traffic on IP/port)
1. RSA Decrypt IMP-HDR w/ Cryptold '8 Private Key.
- Authenticate w/ SHA-l
1. R06 Decrypt Exfil/Metadata w/ CV and MI
- Perform CRC-16 integrity check.
. Anti-Replay Check & New Session/Retransmit Check
2. Extract Metadata and create Collection Filter rule for DPS

Metadata contains either 5-tuples or pattern/mask/offset that match DPs
