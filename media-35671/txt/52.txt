APEX VolP Phases

> VolP Phase 1: Static Tasking of VoIP (Spin El
' HAMMERCHANT monitors VolP SIP/H.323 signaling and exfiltrates only targeted VolP
RTP sessnons to TURMOIL.
' APEX reconstructs and bundles the voice packets into a file, attaches appropriate
metadata, and delivers to PRESSUREWAVE.

' This triggers a modified VolP analytic to prepare the VolP for corporate delivery.

> VolP Phase 2. VoIP Call Survey
I HAMMERCHANT monitors VolP SIP/H.323 signaling and exfiltrates all call signaling
metadata to TURMOIL.
' APEX inserts call signaling metadata into an ASDF record and publishes it to the
TURMOIL Asdeeporter component for target SIGDEV.

> VolP Phase 3. Dynamic Targeting of VolP
' HAMMERSTEIN captures/exfils all VolP signaling
' APEX reconstructs/reinjects the signaling to the TURMOIL VolP components.
' TURMOIL VolP extracts call metadata and sends to FASCIA; checks KEYCARD for hits.
I

If called/calling party is targeted for active exfil, then TURMOIL sends to HAMMERSTEIN
(vra TURBINI ) the parameters to capture the targeted RTP sessron.

> Implementation of VoIP Phase 2 and 3 will be driven by mission need.

I Phase 3 levera es all TU RMQIL VolP signalin protocol processors to expand beyond
SIP and H.323 %e.g. Skype) vvithout additional evelopment on the Implan .
