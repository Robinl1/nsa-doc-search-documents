) APEX VPN Phases

 

> VPN Phase 1: IKE Metadata Onlv (Spin 15)

- IKE packets are exfiled to TURMOIL APEX.
- APEX reconstructs/reinjects IKE packets to the TURMOIL VPN components.

- TURMOIL VPN extracts metadata from each key exchange and sends to the
CES TOYGRIPPE metadata database. This database is used by SIGDEV
analysts to Identify potential targets for further explortatton.

> VPN Phase 2: Targeted IKE Forwarding (Spin 15)
- TURMOIL VPN looks up IKE packet IP addresses in KEYCARD.

- If either IP address is targeted the key exchange ackets are forwarded to
the CES Attack Orchestrator (POISON NUT) for PM key recovery.

> VPN Phase 3: Static Taskino of ESP
- HAMMERSTEIN receives static tasking to exfil targeted ESP packets.
- APEX reconstructs/reinjects ESP packets to the TURMOIL VPN components.

- TURMOIL VPN requests VPN key from CES and attempts decryption.

> VPN Phase 4: Dynamic Targeting of ESP
- Based on the value returned by KEYCARD, the ESP for a particular VPN may

be targeted as well.
- TURMOIL sends to HAMMERSTEIN via TURBINE) the parameters for

capturing the ESP for the targeted VP .
