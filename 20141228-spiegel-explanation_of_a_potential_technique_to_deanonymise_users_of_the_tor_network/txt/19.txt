UK TOP SECRET STRAPl COMINT
A larger experiment

. We want to find some false hits to understand worst
case accuracy for the server—to—client direction

. Let’s open the aperture very wide
— 2027 bearer hours of logs with any time slide
— Filter to all traffic involving a TOR node
. Not just likely guard—to—client traffic as before

. We find some false hits (540) but rate is assessed
to be low enough.

. 92% of false hits are against the big download
session which has little structure
