UK TOP SECRET STRAPl COMINT
Side note: Circuit tracing

- One suggestion was to track packets through each
hop in the TOR network

- We experimented with spotting all links in circuits
created by GCHQ

- Visibility was too low to be a sensible approach
— 13 out. of 8294 potential inter-TOR-router links were seen

- We will directly correlate:
— exit node traffic, and
— traffic between client. and guard node
