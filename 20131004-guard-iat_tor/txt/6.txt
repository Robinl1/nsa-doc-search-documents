(SI/REL) Censorship Driven Protocol Obfuscation — Psiphon 3/ Tor

  
  

  
 

(S/IREL

 
    

Extreme Censorship blocking: Common encrypted protocols
(SI/REL) In the case of Psiphon 3: SSH

(

S/IREL) In the case of Tor. TLS

S/IREL) Make deep packet inspection (XKS 2-) ) work harder

S/IREL) Both use work of a open source project (brl/obfuscated-openssh)

Idea is both sides transmit random seed and verifier information

(SI/REL) Verifier is hash of seed and other data

- (SI/REL) If verifier passes data used from both side seeds to generate key

(SI/REL) Key used in symmetric cipher to encrypt native SSH or SSL protocol

- (SI/REL) So for random stream, need to de-obfuscate and test for SSH/ SSL

(SI/REL) Details for Psiphon 3 .4
- (SI/REL) Hash used for verifier, key generation: 6000 iterations SHA-1 ix

- (SI/REL) Symmetric cipher is RC-4
(SI/REL) Details for Tor Obsfproxy
- (SI/REL) Hash used for verifier, key generation: 100K iterations SHA-256
- (SI/REL) Symmetric cipher is 'AES-CTR-128
- (S//REL) Key uses seed from both sides!
