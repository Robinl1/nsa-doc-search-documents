[Si’t‘Sllt‘REU lf collection operations around the globe are to work in tandem in real-time, then
the processing and exploitation fabric of the SIGINT system must provide for distributed storage
and robust messaging. Fast. ﬂexible, Front-end processors must spot targets based on patterns,
events. or rnetadata rather than pro-deﬁned selectors or brute force scanning of content. High
performance computing systems must extract meaning from huge data sets and to negate data
encryption and computer access controls.

(t'r'r‘Sl/iREL) New developments will stress standardized interfaces that let diverse applications
share infrastructure. and will favor automation and off-the-shelf technology over manual
processes and point solutions New SlGlNT system architectures will de-corrple event detection
