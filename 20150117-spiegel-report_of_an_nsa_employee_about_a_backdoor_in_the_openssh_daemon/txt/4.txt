(U) New Zealand was incredible! I wish I'd had more time there, but I think I
did pretty well. I saw a handful of LOTR sights, Mount Cook, a number of
gorgeous lakes, snow-capped mountains everywhere,

If you want pictures let me know and I'll shoot
you the link.

(U) Tasmania was similarly awesome, and not just because I can now say ”Yea,
I've been to Tasmania,” because, you know, it sounds cool.

(U- at the US. Embassy Independence Day Party!

(U/ /FOUO) My time at DSD came to a close in ]une, as my ﬂight back is on 30
June (26 hours in an airplane, WOO!) I absolutely loved my time in Australia,
both in terms of work and travel, but I'm also looking forward to returning to
the land of Chick—fil—A, college athletics, BBQ pork, and real bacon. Oh, and
good beer.
