Section 1 - Applicability and Scope (U)

These National Security Agency (NSA) minimization procedures apply to the acquisition,
retention, use, and dissemination of non—publicly available information concerning
unconsenting United States persons that is acquired by targeting non—United States persons
reasonably believed to be located outside the United States in accordance with section 702 of
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as amended ("the Act"). (U)

H NSA determines that it must take action in apparent departure from these minimization
procedures to protect against an immediate threat to human life (e. g, force protection or
hostage situations) and that it is not feasible to obtain a timely modiﬁcation of these
procedures, NSA may take such action immediately. NSA will report the action taken to the
Ofﬁce of the Director of National Intelligence and to the National Security Division of the
Department of Justice, which will promptly notify the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Court of such activity. (U)

public communication to which it is not an intended patty. (U)

(b) Communications concerning a United States person include all communications in which
a United States person is discussed or mentioned, except where such communications
reveal only publicly-available information about the person. (U)

(0) Communications of a United States person include all communications to which a United
States person is a party. (U)

(d) Consent is the agreement by a person or organization to permit the NSA to take particular
actions that affect the person or organization. To be effective, consent must be given by
the affected person or organization with sufficient knowledge to understand the action
that may be taken and the possible consequences of that action. Consent by an
organization will be deemed valid if given on behalf of the organization by an official, or
governing body determined by the General Counsel, NSA, to have actual or apparent
authority to make such an agreement. (U)
