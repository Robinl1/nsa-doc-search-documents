Clean Data (U)

(S//Sl//REL) Metrics will only provide a near-accurate picture: ground truth will always be the domain of
the TOPI and based on content

(S//S|//REL) Some selectors (accurately) map to multiple targets, multiple teams, multiple organizations
(S//S|//REL) Some selectors simply don't have a known target, only a target set

(S//REL) Need to correlate across widely different datasets requires creation of normalized bridge
datasets (e.g. comparing executables to domains)

(S//Sl//REL) TKB/U'IT are victims of years of "fill in the blank" freeform data entry; very slowly being
addressed (~2015?)
