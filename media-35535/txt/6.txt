”Count What is countable, measure What is measurable, and make measurable that
which cannot be measured”

Galileo (17th century astronomer)

”When you can measure What you are speaking about, and express it in numbers,
you know something about it; but When you cannot measure it, When you cannot
express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind ”

Lord Kelvin (discovered absolute zero)

”YOu cannot manage what you cannot measure”
Bill Hewlett (co-founder of Hewlett-Packard)

”Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted
counts ”

- Albert Einstein
