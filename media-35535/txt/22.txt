Capability Development

ChaHenges(U)

(TS/lSl/lREL) With rare exceptions,
application-specific solutions are only
built based on these two criteria????

. ln resource-restrained environment, development of capabilities against likely-
to-increase in priority applications is trumped by standing requirements
driven by known priority applications

. Capabilities development response to current/priority technology threats occurs
normally w/in existing resources â€” but response does not scale, either to the
industry or to multiple crises
