Associations to establish a RAS nomination

Reasonable Articulable Suspicion (RAS) standard — requires that an NSA analyst
must be able to point to a single fact that points to the fact that a selector may be
associated with a terrorist group listed in the FISC Order before we are
authorized to conduct analysis on it.

RAS determination — should cause a reasonable person to suspect that the
identifier is associated with one of the terrorist organizations named in the Order.

 

 

Recall that the BR FISC
Order allows NSA to obtain an
immense amount of foreign and US
metadata contained in the Business
Records. The FISC Order contains
strict guidelines on when this metadata
is allowed to be accessed and when it
is not. It must be associated with
specific terrorist organizations named
in the Order. It also must meet a
standard that is referred to as the
Reasonable Articulable Suspicion
(RAS) Standard. In a nutshell, the
RAS standard requires that an NSA
analyst must be able to point to a
single fact that points to the fact that a
seed/telephone selector may be
associated with a terrorist group listed
in the FISC Order before we are
authorized to conduct analysis on it.

_.—€FS#Sl#N-F+We will address the RAS

standard in detail in the next lesson,
but for now, understand that the fact or
facts which make up a RAS
determination should cause a
reasonable person to suspect that the
identifier is associated with one of the
terrorist organizations named in the
Order.
