the US Constitution prohibits Congress
from making any laws that would
infringe on the free exercise of:

Religion

Speech

The press
Peaceable assembly

To petition the government for
redress of grievances

(TS/ISL???) Remember the RAS
Memo clarifies the FlSC's prohibition
of a RAS determination based solely
on activities that are protected by the
First Amendment. This applies when
targeting a US person as defined in
USSID SPOO18 or a person
reasonably believed to be located
inside the United States.
