{FSALSWN-P) BR Orders allow NSA to obtain telephony
metadata from US telecommunication companies,
compelled to do so under a court order. This FlSA
Order requires specified telecommunication providers
to share business records in the form of telephony
metadata with the US government.

WSWN-H—The BR FISA authority is for collection of
tangible things gathered to protect the United States
against international terrorism. BR Orders are
renewed approximately every 60-90 days. We will refer
to the valid order as the FISA BR Order.

-(—'FS#Sl-#NQ Since this authority is concerned only with
metadata and no content of those communications,
NSA has a lower burden of proof for targeting an
identifier when compared to other FISA authorities.

-ﬁSH-Sli+N-F—) All that is required is that a selector meet
the Reasonable Articulable Suspicion (RAS) standard
that a selector is associated with a terrorist group
listed in the BR FISA Order. All of the listed terrorist
groups are associated with I

ﬁS—lfSlﬁN-Fj'AII identifiers are approved by an HMC (or
official named in the Order) prior to querying the
authorized repositories.

-(—'lZS#SWN-l;)- NSA can use identifiers, after they have
been approved for RAS, to query the BR metadata for
counterterrorism threats to the homeland. The BR
Court Order only authorizes contact chaining and

1ueries within the metadata.
