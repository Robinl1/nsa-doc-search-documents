' W You will recall from Lesson

One that the BR FlSA Order is authorized
because the F180 recognizes there is a
counterterrorism interest in obtaining those
business records. However, because NSA
is receiving a great deal of US person
telephony records, we have strict
guidelines on when NSA can access the
metadata under this authority. One of the
requirements is that in order to access the
metadata, NSA must establish RAS on
each selector prior to querying the BR
FlSA repositories.

-€FS+fS-l#NF-)-The BR FlSC Order states
that NSA mav uueoesoeciﬁc identifiers

, ‘ |that satisfy the RAS standard for
purposes of obtaining counterterrorism
intelligence.

—€FSHSI#N-F)—ln order to assist in
determining when a selector has satisfied
the RAS standard, the Ofﬁce of General
Counsel (OGC) has issued a RAS Memo
to help Signals Intelligence Directorate
(SID) personnel make RAS determinations
on telephone identifiers. The memo
contains guidelines that apply to both the
BR and Pen Register and Trap and Trace
(PR/'l‘l') FlSA Orders.
