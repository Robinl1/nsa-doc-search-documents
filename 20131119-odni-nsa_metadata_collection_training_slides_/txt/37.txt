query results apply from USSID SPOO18. In addition,
there are a couple of unique requirements:

Chief S12 or the NSOC SOO (or one of the three other
named positions in the BR FlSA Order) must approve
the dissemination of US person information

2. Any US person information disseminated must be for a
counterterrorism purpose and necessary to understand
the counterterrorism information or assess its
importance.

 

 

—(—'FS#Sl#N-F—)-The court-ordered
minimization procedures for BR FlSA
disseminations differ from NSA’s
standard USSID SPOO18 procedures
in the following key aspects:

1.The Chief of S12 (or approved
officials named in the court order)
or the National Security
Operations Center Senior
Operations Officer (NSOC 800)
must approve the dissemination of ‘
US person information. (please
refer to the glossary for a definition
of dissemination)

2.Dissemination of US person
information must be for a
counterterrorism purpose and only
if necessary to understand or
assess the counterterrorism
purpose. This applies to both BR
FlSA Query analysts and
individuals who have received
query results.

3.Further, all disseminations must

be reported in a weekly report to
the FISC.
