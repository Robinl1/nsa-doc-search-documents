(TS//SI) Cryptanalysts at the cryptologic centers will access data that is stored in the following
databases at N SAW:

FOURSCORE - fax and DNI data, some of which is NSA or FBI FISA-derived

ZAP - text, some of which is NSA or FBI FISA-derived

CAPRICORN - voice, some of which is N SA or FBI FISA-derived

SOAPOPERA - voice, end product, SRI information, some of which is NSA or FBI FISA—derived

(TS//SI) These databases contain raw data, including enciphered collection, and, when exploitation
is possible, decrypted plain text. Some of the data in the databases is NSA F ISA—derived or FBI CT
FISA-derived. While not every database contains FISA-derived material, it is reasonable to expect
that analysts at the 00s will perform mission with agility, moving across targets and databases as
mission demands, and that sometimes that will mean accessing data within a database that does
contain FISA-derived data. Access to these databases is restricted to analysts who hold the
RAGTIME ECI, have a Speciﬁc ‘need to know' about the data stored within the databases, and who
are authorized by the data owner. For some years CES has been the recipient of improperly
marked/classiﬁed data but. all analysts have been and are aware that data marked with the SIGAD
U8984J and case notation XX.SQF* is FBI FISA data, and that all other data marked with SIGAD
{IS-984* is NSA FISA data. CES believes that the appropriate remedy is to correct the
classiﬁcation of the data before it is fed into our systems. This is an ongoing issue which should not
impede the approval of this SPF but the matter should be addressed. CES will ensure that all
analysts accessing these databases know that data marked with the SIGAD US984J and case
notation XXSQIM is FBI FISA data, and that all other data marked with SIGAD US-984* is NSA
FISA data, and that this data should be classiﬁed TOP SECRET/lCOMINT — ECI RAGTIMEl/
NOFORN. Ideally all FISA and non—FISA material should be held separately, and FBI and NSA
FISA should be partitioned by individual target. The Ofﬁce of Oversight and Compliance will work
with SB dataﬂow and Special Source Operations to correct the markings/classiﬁcation of data at the
front end.

(S/lSI) CES at NSAW will work to ensure that all individuals working the cryptanalysis mission at
the CC5 have the appropriate clearances for access to sensitive data, including RAGTIME, and will
dictate speciﬁc policy and procedural security measures.

REQUIREMENTS: (TS//SI//N F ) Following recent meetings and discussions among SID Oversight
and Compliance (SV) and NSAW CES, the following are recommendations and requirements that
CES and the Cryptologic Centers should agree to implement prior to accessing, handling,
processing, retaining, and disseminating N SA FISA and CT FBI FISA-derived collection.

SV reguirements: NSA/CBS TX, NSA/CSS GA, and NSA/CSS HI should commit to:

l) (S//SI) The creation of a permanent FISA coordinator position, to be staffed initially by a
person experienced with FISA procedures, to ensure compliance with FISA minimization
procedures; build a culture and climate of FISA awareness; and facilitate onosite ability to train,
ﬁeld questions, and handle time-sensitive FISA issues.

(S//SI) NSA/CSS TX has identiﬁed a permanent FISA coordinator; however that
person has no FISA experience. The CES Mission Manager at TX, who has F ISA experience, must
perform oversight of CES activities and must participate in the new coordinator’s FISA training.
SID Oversight & Compliance will brief both individuals on their responsibilities.
