['l'S'i'SIJ For example, the databases FOURSCORI: and ZAP
contain both NSA FISA and Flil l-‘ISA that does not carry the
appropriate classiﬁcation (all NSA and FBI I-‘ISA material
must carry the “'l'Sﬁ'SI-liCl RGTE’NUFORNEEZUZW 23"
classiﬁcation. FBI PISA should also be marked with the
OGC-approved FBI FISA banner]. Further, NSA FISA and
FBI FISA materials are mixed together within the databases.
despite the differences in allowed retention between the two
versions of PISA. and both are mixed with non-FISA
material. CES should also provide SV with an SOP clarifying
how access [by botlt CIES and 52 target analysts} to these
target folders is maintained. including what checks are m
place to verify user clearances to View NSA FISA andfor FBI
l-‘JSA material.

{TSL‘SD If you support access in principle. I would
recommend that no action be taken to establish accounts at the
CCS for these CES databases until SV can ensure that the
issues of classiﬁcation. partitioning and seems are resolved
and any existing PISA access or retention W'CllElllUIlS are
identiﬁed and cleared up.

('I'SJJ'SI] l-‘unher, SV reeottuncnds tltat this access not be
approved until S3ICES and the Crvptologic Centers involved
coordinate with the ofﬁces that sponsored the NSA PISA
court orders and agree to the rtsponsibililics that cach will
have relative to satisfying the FISA minimization procedures
(USSII) SPOU | 8. Annex A]. This is necessary to ensure that
all individuals who toueh NSA HSA material personally
abide by NSA‘s FISA handling and minimization
requirements. ensure that no one makes erroneous
assumptions about what another ofﬁce is :doing vis-a-vis
meeting those requirements. and ensure that the NSA
declarant can swear under oath that NSA abides by its
obligations.
