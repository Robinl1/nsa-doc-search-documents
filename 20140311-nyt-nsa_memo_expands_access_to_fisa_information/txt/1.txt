PURPOSE: (TS/ISU/NF) To obtain SID approval for Cryptanalysis and Exploitation Services (CES)
cryptanalysts at the NSA/CSS CryptoIOgic Centers (003) in Texas, Georgia, and Hawaii, who are
under direct DIRNSA authority, to access and process NSA SIGINT FISA and CT FBI SIGINT

FISA data that is stored in databases in CBS at NSAW. This will set a precedent for access to NSA
PISA material outside of NSAW.

BACKGROUND: (TS/ISI) As part of CES’s strategy for the Extended Enterprise buildout,
cryptanalysis efforts at the cryptologic centers in Texas, Georgia, and Hawaii will serve as
transparent extensions of the cryptanalysis mission performed by CBS in the Ofﬁce of Target
Pursuit’s exploitation branches (831142, 831143, 831131, and 831133) at NSAW. Analysts at the
cryptologic centers will become part ofa virtual team with NSAW analysts. They will access data
that is stored within the CBS ﬁrewall and will use cryptanalytic procedures and tools, also within
the CES ﬁrewall, by way of a VPN capability that ensures that security is not compromised and
that the data and tools accessed cannot get out to the local network. The priorities of cryptanalytic

missions will continue to be set in conjunction with mission elements at NSAW and the Cryptologic
Centers as appropriate.
