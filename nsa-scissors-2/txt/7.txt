TOP SECRET/ISll/NOFORN

So What?

- Store less of the wrong data
— 20% reduction (so far) in content to long-term repositories
— Data still resides at site for SIGDEV
- Increase data variety
— Hole left by “wrong data” filled with more “right data”
— More signals and case notations can be tasked at site
- Shifting collection philosophy at NSA

— “Memorialize what you need” versus “Order one of
everything off the menu and eat what you want”
