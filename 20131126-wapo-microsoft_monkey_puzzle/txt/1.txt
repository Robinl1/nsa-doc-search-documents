Subject: RE: (U) MUSCULAR and realms
Classiﬁcation: SECRET
I can answer this.

MP does not reject selectors based on their realm is wrong here). MP will
accept any targeting into its pool as long as it passes t e po my and legality checks, aka
front door rules. These do not test the selector value or its realm. However, MP (v6) will
not deploy any targeting for realms other than emailAddr, google, msnpassport and
yahoo. So for the unsupported realms, UTT should still be getting an Added or Updated
targeting action response from MP (implying the targeting is in the pool), but an empty
targeting summary since it did not go anywhere....

NSA could send us whatever realms they like right now, but the targeting just won't go
anywhere unless it's of one of the above 4 realms. I hope they don't as we've not sized

our database to cater for all it...

Hope this all makes sense...
