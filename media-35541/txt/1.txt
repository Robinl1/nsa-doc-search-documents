OPC—MCR Mathematical Information Processing Research Task:
TOR deanonymisation

Customer: ICTR—NE
Status: in pullthrough (started
December 2010)

Can we denonymise TO_R? In
other words, if given some
trafﬁc from a TOR exit node,
can we ﬁnd the IP address of
the user associated with that
trafﬁc?

[m] Research

A circuit tracing attack was
ﬁrst considered. However
ICTR—NE signatures run by
TDSD showed that our
coverage of TOR is too low to
have a reasonable chance of
doing such an attack; on
JTRIG paths we only saw 2
out of 8294 potential inter—
TOR—node links.

Instead we are now

considering an entry—exit correlation attack. Data collected from
ICTR—NE/JTRIG infrastructure showed that some timing structure is
preserved between entry and exit node.
