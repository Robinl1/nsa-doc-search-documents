Nodes: Baseline Our Nodes

How many nodes do we have cooperative or
direct access to? Can we deploy similar code
to these nodes to aid with circuit
reconstruction?

Can we do packet timing attacks using nodes?
Can we use the nodes to shape trafﬁc flow?

Can we use the nodes to deny/degrade/disrupt
comms to certain sites?
