Tor Stinks... But it Could be Worse

(S//S|)

° Critical mass of targets use Tor. Scaring them
away from Tor might be counterproductive.

' We can increase our success rate and provide
more client IPs for individual Tor users.

° Will never get 100% but we don’ t need to

provide true lPs for every target every time
they use Tor.
