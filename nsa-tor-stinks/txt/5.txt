° Current: access to m few nodes. Success rate negligible
because all three Tor nodes in the circuit have to be in the set
of nodes we have access to.

— Difﬁcult to combine meaningfully with passive SIGINT.

- Goal: expand number of nodes we have access to
— GCHQ runs Tor nodes under NEWTONS CRADLE (how many?)
— Other partners?
— Partial reconstruction (ﬁrst hops or last hops)?
