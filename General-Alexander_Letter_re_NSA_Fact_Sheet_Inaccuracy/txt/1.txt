Dear Senators Wyden and Udall:

Thank you for your letter dated 24 June 2013. After reviewing your letter, I agree that

the fact sheet that the National Security Agency posted on its website on 18 June 2013 could
have more precisely described the requirements for collection under Section 702 of the F ISA
Amendments Act. This statute allows for “the targeting of persons reasonably believed to be
located outside the United States to acquire foreign intelligence information.” 50 U.S.C.
1881(a). The statute provides several express limitations, namely that such acquisition:

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

may not intentionally target any person known at the time of acquisition to be located
in the United States;

may not intentionally target a person reasonably believed to be located outside the
United States if the purpose of such acquisition is to target a particular, known person
reasonably believed to be in the United States;

may not intentionally target a United States person reasonably believed to be located
outside the United States;

may not intentionally acquire any communication as to which the sender and all
intended recipients are known at the time of acquisition to be located in the United
States; and

shall be conducted in a manner consistent with the fourth amendment to the
Constitution ofthe United States. 50 U.S.C. 1881(b).

With respect to the second point raised in your 24 June 2013 letter, the fact sheet did not

imply nor was it intended to imply “that NSA has the ability to determine how many American
communications it has collected under section ”3'02, or that the law does not allow the NSA to
deliberately search for the records of particular Americans." As you correctly state. this point
has been addressed publicly. I refer you to unclassiﬁed correspondence ﬁom the Director of
National Intelligence dated 26 July 2012 and 24 August 2012.
