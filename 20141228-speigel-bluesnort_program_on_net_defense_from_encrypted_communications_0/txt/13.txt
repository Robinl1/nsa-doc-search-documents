from CoreSSC, pulls the GW IP addresses from the
Targeting database; issues control—flow messages
for each |P:Port combination and sends periodic
updates for those.

 

2; FCP responds to control—flow messages by

promoting all packets to/from the targeted |P:port
combinations, and PacketRouter ensures these
packets are sent to GW-FIP for sessionization. GW-
FIP outputs 'raw' SOTF session—fragments to the
TE-GW service on the same host.

GW—SessionFilter identifies sessions containing
target technology—of—interest by applying an
appropriate appld tag to each session-fragment.

5;. GW—FragmentFilter removes session—fragments not

containing an appropriate appld for the target
technology—of—interest. Additionally, as a work—
around for an issue in FIP 3.1.10, erroneous
session—fragments missing a specific metadata
filed are removed. GW-MI applies SRI obtained
from Dfid Allocator.

REGWQMI applies SRI obtained from the DFID

allocator.
