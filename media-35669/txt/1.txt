(U) Stealthy Techniques Can Crack Some of SIGINT’s
Hardest Targets

(TS/lSI/INF) Not all SIGINT tradecraft involves accessing signals and
networks from thousands of miles away... In fact, sometimes it is very
hands-on (literally!) Here’s how it works: shipments of computer network 1 1
devices (servers, routers, etc.) being delivered to our targets throughout the world are
intercepted. Next, they are redirected to a secret location where Tailored Access
Operations/Access Operations (AO — S326) employees, with the support of the Remote
Operations Center (S321), enable the installation of beacon implants directly into our
targets’ electronic devices. These devices are then re-packaged and placed back into
transit to the original destination. All of this happens with the support of Intelligence
Community partners and the technical wizards in TAO.

 

 

 

(TS/lSI/INF) Such operations involving supply-chain interdiction are some of the most
productive operations in TAO, because they pre-position access points into hard target
networks around the world.

implants a beacon

(TS/lSI/INF) In one recent case, after several months a beacon implanted through supply-
chain interdiction called back to the N SA covert infrastructure. This call back provided
us access to further exploit the device and survey the network. Upon initiating the survey,
SIGINT analysts from TAO/Requirements & Targeting determined that the implanted
device was providing even greater accesses than we had hoped: We knew the devices
were bound for the Syrian Telecommunications Establishment (STE) to be used as part of
their intemet backbone, but what we did not know was that STE’s GSM (cellular)
