 

TOP SECRET STRAP 2

Fusion of sources

 

Aim is to bring all sources that help identify NOC lP ranges
together with associated confidence.

Different techniques provide different results due to the nature of
passive access (international v’s in-country for instance)

Different techniques have different levels of reliability — therefore
looking to develop aggregation with overlay of smart
intelligence.

Solution can work on not just ISP
NOCs but also Mobile OMCs.
