 

TOP SECRET STRAP 2
Phase 3: Intelligent use of TELNET traffic

 

- Again we do not always get full configuration files. Phase 1 is
based on full (or as near to full) configuration files

- GCHQ NAC collect TELNET Sessions into TERMINAL SURGE
— Collection based on TCP Port 23 (TELNET)
— Other protocols use TCP Port 23 (YMSG)

- Interaction with Routers over TCP Port 23 maybe nefarious:
— Scanning
— Password guessing

- Need to separate legitimate use from nefarious activity
- Look for signs of legitimate use.

— Successful Iogin
— Follow on commands
