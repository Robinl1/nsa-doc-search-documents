GCHQ / CSEC NAC Joint tradecraft development

 

- During March 2011 GCHQ Analysts visited CSEC to look at the
using PENTAHO for tradecraft modelling working with CSEC
NAC and CSEC/H3 software developers to see it could model
NOCTURNAL SURGE in PENTAHO and then implement in
OLYMPIA.

- Only possible to attempt because:
— GCHQ NAC use PENTAHO
— CSEC NAC/H3 use PENTAHO
— CSEC NAC have implemented GCHQ NAC TIDAL SURGE Database
Schema (DSD also have this..)
- GCHQ approach based on AS

- CSEC approach based on Country
