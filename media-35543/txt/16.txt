False positive rate False positive rate

Figure 7: The ROC curve for the client—to—server direction (false—positive rate shown on
a linear axis in the left plot and on a logarithmic axis in the right plot).

In the client—to—server direction, the true and false cases are not so well separated, see
ﬁgure 7. We are not able to detect any true positives without some false hits. This poor
separation is probably due to there being less distinctive structure in the client—to—server
direction; HTTP requests share a similar size.

In the server—to—client direction a threshold of 0.998 finds the true cases (except
“2a”) without any false hits. We can try to extrapolate what this false hit rate means to
SIGINT collection. It is likely that one would restrict the time slide; we would imagine a
maximum of 5 seconds may be sensible as opposed to the 2 hours in each bearer we have
allowed. If we imagine restacking our 5circuits >< 4bearers X 120 minutes of collection
into 288 circuits X 100 bearers X 10 seconds you could imagine it is possible we could run
288 test circuits against an aperture of 100 bearers without false hitting when allowing
ourselves to slide the time window by 5 seconds. With our current test data we can’t
promise a lower false positive rate and further experimentation with sustained collection
would be required to better evaluate a false positive rate.

8 Software

We provide a reference implementation of the algorithm as an R package “ﬂowcompare”.
Three functions are provided:

formatﬂowdata Formats data to that used internally in the algorithm.
