UK TOP SECRET STRAPl COMINT

OPC—M/TECHB/61

c We must be able to log the packet times of the traffic from the guard node to the
client.

a The TOR communication must be long and structured. We will demonstrate the
technique against a single user browsing the web via TOR.

o The client must not be running a TOR router of their own — otherwise we can not
separate the client’s own traffic from other TOR traffic.

The attack we will present is based on correlating exit node and guard node traffic and
does not require tracking communications through any intermediate link in the TOR
network. This approach should help maximise the chance of a successful attack despite
incomplete SIGINT coverage.

2 Test data

we are going to work with two sets of data:

1. Truthed data where we have matched guard node and exit node trafﬁc for a single
user web browsing.

2. Bulk trafﬁc logs for guard nodes from four SIGINT bearers.

we will try to develop techniques that can correctly match up the truth data but not
false alarm anywhere in the bulk SIGINT logs.

2.1 Truthed data

TOR is designed to make it hard to link client and exit node trafﬁc together. In conjunc—
tion with lCTR—NE and JTRIG we came up with a way to collect the exit node trafﬁc
from our own web browsing. As illustrated in ﬁgure 1 we used a virtual private server
(VPS) as an intermediate destination for our trafﬁc. W'e then run packet loggers on our
client machine and the VPS.

We run an open HTTP proxy server on the VPS. we want to run an open proxy server
to ensure that there is minimal impact on the data flows (which, for example, authenti—
cation may introduce) whilst still being able to conduct representative web browsing. A
risk of an open proxy server is that other internet users may use it thus potentially lead—
ing to unlawful traffic interception. To avoid this danger we changed our “User—Agent”
string to a non—standard value and the proxy server was conﬁgured to only respond to
this user agent. Furthermore the proxy server was only active for the brief duration of
the experiment. This setup was approved by JTRIG. No trafﬁc due to other users was
detected in the packet logs.
