—(=FS#S+H-NF} (Technical Character): Next we will discuss the compliance certiﬁcation process used by technical personnel who develop mission
technologies to include those supporting the BR and PR/TT Programs. Compliance certification is a mandatory check for all systems handling US. person
or FISA data. Guidelines governing the certification process are maintained by the TD Compliance Office. This process supports compliance with the
applicable laws and authorities and supports the NSA Way. The NSA Way is a uniﬁed framework for building large (or small), complex, primarily software
