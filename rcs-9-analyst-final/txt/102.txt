What you should know about alerts

What are alerts

During the investigation phase, being "alerted" on special events that concern the target in real-
time via e-mail or notification on RC5 Console, can be helpful.

Alerts can be received when:
1- new evidence arrives
a the agent synchronizes
. entities are automatically created and connected (intelligence)

For example, if awaiting evidence from a target for a long time, an alert rule can be created to
send an e-mail and record a log for each piece of evidence received. This way, users are
immediately notified when the target resumes activities. The rule can be disabled later and
evidence can simply be viewed as it arrives.

Or, if intelligence is used, it could be helpful to be "alerted" when a link is created with a certain
entity or a new entity is created in the operation.

Alert rules

Alert rules set which events generate alerts. They can also be used to automatically assign levels
of relevance to evidence or intelligence links which can be used in the analysis phase.

Alert rule application field
Rules that alert the arrival of evidence can be created on the following levels:

. Operation: all evidence for all operation targets
. Target: all evidence for all target agents
0 Agent: all agent evidence

Rules that alert the automatic creation of an intelligence entity can be created on the following
levels:

. Operation: alerts when an entity is created for that operation
Rules that alert the automatic creation of an intelligence link can be created on the following
levels:

. Operation: alerts when a link is created for any entity in the operation
