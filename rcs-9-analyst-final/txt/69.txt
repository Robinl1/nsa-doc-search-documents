RCS 9 - Managing Peer and Know links

 

Managing Peer and Know links

The analyst manages links so they represent the evolution of the investigation, thus:

0 adds or edits links between two entities when in possession of information that prove a

relationship between the two

0 assigns a level of relevance to links to represent the rel ationship's relevance in the inves-
tigation

o deletes links when in possession of information that prove the lack of relations or that the
relationship is insigniﬁcant to the investigation.

Identity links

Identity links represent a suggestion of an identity relationship between two entities that
represent people. This type of link is automatically created by the system when the two entities
share at least one identiﬁcation (i.e.: phone number).

Identity links do not have directions.

Managing Identity links

The analyst must decide the reason for identity links and how to act accordingly:
0 if they are the same person, the two entities must be merged;
in if they are two different people that used the same identification, the shared identification
must be deleted from one of the entities and the link eliminated.

Link time value

Links are the result of an automatic or manual process completed at a certain time. However, the
time the link is created, meaning when the first relationship was formed between entities, is only
logged for Peer links automatically created by the system.

This way, an analysis period can be selected to see when certain relationships were created.

For the other links, once they are created (automatically or manually) they are considered as
created at the beginning by the system.
