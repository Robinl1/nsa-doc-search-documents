Intelligence process

Phase

Description

 

1

The system creates an operation in the Intelligence section when an operation is
opened in the Operations section.

The system creates a Target entity when a target is created in the Operations sec-
tion.

The system, based on the evidence collected from target devices, creates links with
target entities and creates new entities.

The analyst adds entities to represent people, places and web pages deemed of
interest for the investigation and adds details.

The system continues to update entities and their links based on new evidence and
information added by the analyst.

The analyst interprets and manages entities and their links to propose solutions for
the investigation.

0 NOTE: the analyst can set an alert rule to be alerted when the system
creates an entity or link. See ’ﬁierting " on page 90.
