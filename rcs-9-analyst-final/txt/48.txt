RC5 9 - Translating evidence

Translating evidence

communicates with a third party translation software that returns text translated into the
interface language.

RC5 Translate translates the following types of evidence:

0 clipboard

The translation is displayed in the page with the evidence list and the single piece of evidence
detail page.

Delete evidence

depends on the type of license installed.

exported).

simultaneously.
