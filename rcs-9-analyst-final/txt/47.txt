RCS 9 - Whatyou should know about evidence

What you should know about evidence

Analysis process
The analysis process is described below:

Phase Description

 

1 As the system collects evidence from the agent, it displays and updates the total
counter.

2 The Analyst views all evidence and tags it for easy table consultation and
subsequent export.

3 The Analyst analyzes incoming evidence details.

4 At the end of the investigation or upon request, the Analyst exports evidence to a
file that can be viewed in a browser.

Evidence accumulated in the device.

Evidence is sent by the agent to the Collector in order of creation. If a device rarely synchronizes
or has a limited bandwidth, evidence probably accumulates on the device and it will take a long
time before the most recent data is received.

The same may happen if large-sized evidence is in queue: the most recent evidence can only be
sent after having sent this evidence.

For this reason, we suggest you delete older evidence and/or evidence that exceeds a certain size.
Evidence is deleted at the next synchronization.

See ’Stlgent page" on page 29 .

Filtering evidence
Column heading filters can be used to limit the amount of evidence viewed.
See "Shared interface eiements and actions" on page 11

0 IMPORTANT: if no evidence is displayed, check the counter at the bottom right. If a
value like "011270" is displayed, this means that there is a ﬁlter set that prevents
evidence from being displayed.

The selected filters can be saved with a short description to be used later.

0 IMPORTANT: if private ﬁlters are set, they cannot be used by other users.
