RC5 9 - Position entity

 

Position entity

The Position entity can be manually created by the analyst or automatically by the system.

The Position entity is defined by the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) or address of
the site that it represents and a range of precision.

0 NOTE: the range of precision must be suited to the type of place (i.e.: 50-100m for a
building, much more for a park).

See "Position entity details” on page 79

Virtual entity

The Virtual entity must be manually created by the Analyst.
The Virtual entity is defined by one or more URL addresses for the web page they represent.
See "Virtual entity details” on page 81

See "What you should know about links".

Introduction

A link is a relationship between entities. There can be only one link between two entities.
There are three types of links:

‘ ............. Know
0 — Peer
0 ---- Identity

Know links

Know links represent a know type relationship. Two entities have a Know link when at least one of
the two has the other in hisfher address book.

A Know link can be directional or bi-directional.

Peer links

Peer links indicate that there was a contact between the two entities.

Two entities that represent people have a Peer link when there was a direct communication
between the two entities (i.e.: phone call, chat). The relationship can be directional and bi-
directional.

An entity that represents a person and one that represents a place have a Peer link when the
person was in that place (physical or on the web). The relationship is only directional: from the
entity that represents a person to the one that represents a place.

Peer links represent a stronger relationship than know links, thus they replace any Know link
between the entities.
