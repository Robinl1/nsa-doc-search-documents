of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.” In re Winship, 397 US. 358, 364
(1 9 70).

weight and gravity that due process requires the state to justify conﬁnement by proof more substantial than
a mere preponderance 'of the evidence ” The Court held that the “clear and convincing” standard was

crime will be found. ” Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 238 (1983).
