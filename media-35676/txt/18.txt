2.4. (U/IFOUO) Transmission

(UllFOUO) Session Announcements can be transmitted in several ways. These are:
0 Raw IP packet (TCP/UDP/ICMP), sent to predetermined LP and port.
- TCP connection
- Steganographic Tunnel

(UllFOUO) Using a raw IP packet, a single IP packet would be constructed where the SA would be
contained within the IP transport protocol's payload. The IP and transport protocol (T CPlUDPlICMP)
would be constructed to route the packet to a predetermined destination IP address, IP protocol, and
for TCPlUDP the port number. This method provides no reliable transport. Note: Currently, only
UDP SA packets have been implemented.
