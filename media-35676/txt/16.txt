2.3.2.1 (UllFOUO) Encryption: NONE

(CllSl) Encryption type "NONE“ is implied if none of the encryption related SHELLGREY
tags described below are present within the Metadata Block.

2.3.2.2 (UllFOUO) Encryption: Munge

(Cl/SI) Munge is defined as a1 or 4 byte pattern XOR-ed with the data. When a 1 byte
pattern is used the data is also XOR-ed with the positional index modulo 255. The munge
pattern and the portion of the Packet Layer that is munged are passed during the Session
Announcement in the meta-data block as one of the tags listed below. This pattern must be
consistent throughout the session, and should not be changed in mid session. The
SHELLGREY tags are:

Name Tag Values Packet Layer
EXFIL_MUNGE_BYTE 3C 1-byte unsigned No operation
