Big-Data Computational Challenge

All the previous analytics, while successful experimentally,
ran much too slowly to allow for practical productization

CARE: Collaborative Analytics Research Environment

a big-data system being trialed at CSEC (with NSA launch assist)
non-extraordinary hardware

minimal impedance between memory, storage and processors
highly optimized, in-memory database capabilities

columnar storage, high performance vectorfunctional runtime
powerful but challenging programming language (derived from APL)

Result of first experiments with CARE: gameâ€”changing
run-time for hop-profiles reduced from 2+ Hrs to several seconds
allows for tradecraft to be profitably productized
