Tradecraft Problem Statement

 

 

 

 

A kidnapper based in a rural area travels to an urban area to
make ransom calls

can’t risk bringing attention to low-population rural area
won’t use phone for any other comms (or uses payphones ...)

Assumption: He has another device that accesses IP
networks from public access points

having a device isn’t necessary, could use internet cafes, libraries etc.
he is also assumed to use IP access around the time of ransom calls

Question: Knowing the time of the ransom calls can we
discover the kidnapper’s IP lD/device
”contact chain” across air-gap (not a correlation of selectors)
