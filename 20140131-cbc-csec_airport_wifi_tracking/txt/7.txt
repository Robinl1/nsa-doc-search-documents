Data Reality

The analytic produced excellent profiles, but was more
complex than initial concept suggests

Data had limited aperture — Canadian Special Source
major CDN ISPs team with US email majors, losing travel coverage

Behaviour at airports

little lingering on arrival; arrivals using phones, not WiFi
still, some Wi-Fi use when waiting for connecting flight/baggage
different terminals: domestic/international; also private lounges

Very many airports and hotels served by large Boingo
private network

not seen in aperture; traffic seems to return via local Akamai node
