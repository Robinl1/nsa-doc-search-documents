(TS//Sl//REL TO USA, FVEY) Support the SIGINT exploitation of NGW, a MIR/NIP collective
investment. This request reflects only the NIP portion of the program. Refer to MIP NSA volume for details
on MIP related activities.

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Provide for continued partnerships with major telecommunications carriers
to shape the global network to benefit other collection accesses and allow the continuation ofpartnering with
commercial Managed Security Service Providers and threat researchers, doing threat/vulnerability analysis.

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Continue relationships with commercial IT artners and ea italize on new
opportunities, including the enabling of cryptography used by the #
governments; enable the encryption being used in a high interest satellite signal, which allows access to the
communications being carried on a commercial satellite provider.

(U) There are no new activities in this Project for FY 2013.

(U) The CCP expects this Project to accomplish the following in FY ZOl 3:

(TS/lSI//NF) Reach an initial operating capability for SIGINT access to data flowing through a commercial
Arabic language/Middle East~oriented anonymous internet service. [CCP_OOOO9]

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Reach full operating capability for SIGINT access to data flowing through
a hub for a major commercial communications provider and assess its long term beneﬁts.

(TS//Sl//REL TO USA, FVEY) Reach full operating capability for SIGINT access to a major Internet Peer—
to—Peer voice and text communications system.

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Complete enabling for—encryption chips used in Virtual
Private Network and Web encryption devices. [CCP_00009J

(TS//Sl//REL TO USA, FVEY) Make gains in enabling decryption and Computer Network Exploitation
(CNE) access to fourth generation/Long Term Evolution (4G/LTE) networks via enabling. [CCP_00009]

(TS//Sl//REL TO USA, FVEY) Assess existing wireless calling metadata accesses and balance flow of this
data into NSA/CSS with the ability to ingest and utilize this information. lCO_00047]

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Assess existing commercial cyber information ﬂows and balance the flow
of this data into NSA/CSS with the ability to ingest and analyze this information to support cyber situational
awareness. l'CO_00047]

(TS//Sl//NF) Shape the worldwide commercial cryptography marketplace to make it more tractable to
advanced cryptanalytic capabilities being developed by NSA/CSS. [CCP 00090]

(U) Changes From FY 2012 to FY 2013:
(S//NF) SIGINT Enabling: $20.4 million (-$20.4 Base), -2 civilian positions. The aggregate decrease is
the result of:

116

(U) Increases:
— (TS/Sl/lNF) $5.6 million reﬂects additional level of investment in enabling exploitation capabilities
against NGW mobile and data networks.

— (TS//Sl//NF) $4.1 million enables additional support to Endpoint operations. Support to this mission
area requires SlGlNT Enabling to invest in new infrastructure and capabilities with commercial

partners.

— (S//NF) $0.4 million in civilian pay and benefits.
