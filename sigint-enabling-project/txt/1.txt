(U) Project Description

(TS//SI//NF) The SIGINT Enabling Project actively engages the US and foreign IT industries to covertly
inﬂuence and/or overtly leverage their commercial products’ designs. These design changes make the systems
in question exploitable through SlGlNT collection (cg, Endpoint, MidPoint. etc.) with foreknowledge of the
modification. To the consumer and other adversaries, however, the systems’ security remains intact, ln this
way, the SIGINT Enabling approach uses commercial technology and insight to manage the increasing cost and
technical challenges ofdiscovering and successfully exploiting systems ofinterest within the ever—more integrated
and security~focused global communications environment.

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) This Project supports the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity
Initiative (CNCI) by investing in corporate partnerships and providing new access to intelligence sources,
reducing collection and exploitation costs of existing sources', and enabling expanded network operation and
intelligence exploitation to support network defense and cybcr situational awareness. This Project contains the

SIGINT Enabling Sub—Project.
(U) Base resources in this project are used to:
- (TS//SI//RBL TO USA, FVEY) Insert vulnerabilities into commercial encryption systems, IT systems,
networks, and endpoint communications devices used by targets.

v (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Collect target network data and metadata via cooperative network carriers
and/or increased control OVer core networks,

. (TS//Sl//REL TO USA, FVEY) Leverage commercial capabilities to remotely deliver or receive information
to and from target endpoints.

' (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Exploit foreign trusted computing platforms and technologies.

- (TS//SI//REI., TO USA, FVEY) Inﬂuence policies, standards and specification for commercial public key
technologies.

. (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Make specific and aggressive investments to facilitate the development of
a robust exploitation capability against Next—Generation Wireless (NGW) communications.

- (UNFOUO) Maintain understanding of commercial business and technology trends.

- (U//FOUO) Procure products for internal evaluation.

- (U//FOUO) Partner with industry and/or government agencies in developing technologies of strategic
interest to NSA/CSS.
