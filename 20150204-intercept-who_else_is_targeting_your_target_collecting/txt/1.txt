(TS//Sl//REL) Hackers are steattng the emat1s or some or our targets... by co11ecttng the hackers "take," we 1) get access to the emat1s themsetves and Z)gcl1ns1ghls1nlo who‘s betng hacked.
(TS//Sl//REL) 1>eop1e who open attachments rrom unknown senders (gasp) or respond to "ther-tan" money 1aunder-tng emat1s arcn‘l the on1y tndtvtduals on the tnternet betng hacked. 5ome oftmr targets are also betng targeted by outstde rorces, both by statesponsored and rroe1ance hackers. Could your largcl‘s comnntntcattons be the
target or other countrtes or groups?

(TS//Sl//REL) Recently, Comnntntcattons 5ecunty Establtshment Canada (CSEC) and Menwtth Ht11 51attontMH51dtscovered and began cXplolllng a target-nch data set betng stolen by hackers. The hackers‘ sophtsttcated emat1-stea1tng tntruston set ts known as 1NT0LERANT. or the tramc observed, near1y halrcontatns category htts
because the attackers are targettng emat1 accounts ortnterest to the 1nte11tgence Communlly. Although a re1attve1y new data source, T01>1s have already wntten nntlttple reports based on 1NT0LERANT co11ect.

 

(U)Teclmique

(TS//Sl//REL) To the ana1yst ustng SIGINT databases, cottected INTOLERANT data 1ooks 1tke 5tmp1e Matt Transrer 1>rotoco1 (SMTP) mat1. 1n thts case, though, the trarrtc ratry has been hard at work... To htde the trarrtc, the hackers programs sp1tt a vtcttms ematt tnto pte Each pte e ts then obruscated, gtven a dtrrerent, spooted,
source 11> address and sent to a dtrrerent desttnatton 11> address. Havtng dtrrerent desttnatton 11> addresses serves to route the pteces across separate channets‘ ora sate11tte stgna1. The channels betng used carry 1arge amounts oroarrtc, a11owtng1NT0LERANT data to htde as background notse. Much co11abotatton between c5E, MHS,
GCHQ and NSAW has broughl aboul lhc lmnsl‘ormallon OPINTOLERANT dala wc mllccl 1nl0 "readable" SMTP mall.

   

(U//FOUO) Victim Set

(TS//Sl//REL) 1NT0LERANT tramc ts very organuod. Each event ts 1abe1ed to tdenttry and calcgorm: vtcttms. Cyber attacks commonly app1y descrtptors to each vtcttm -1l he1ps herd vtcttms and track whtch attacks succeed and whtch rat1. Vtcttm categot-tes make 1NT0LERANT tnteresttng:

(TS//Sl//REL) New vtcttms appear to ﬂood out thetr enttre 1nbox, gotng back months or, even, years. Then only new mat1 ts transmttted. Hundreds or emat1s are seen on an average day.
(u) Attribution

(TS//Sl//REL)W1|J-11n the wor1d orcyber cxplollallon, attnbutton ts a1ways dtrrtcutt and INTOLERANT ts no exceptton. 1nttta1ana1ysts potnts toward a 1tke1y state sponsor based on the 1eve1 orsophtsttcatton and the vtcttm set. Determtntng whtch state ts sponsonng the acttvtty has yet to be done. 5tnce the tramc ts travettng over sate11tte,
the cu1prtt must be wtthtn the sate11tte bcarn‘s rootpnnt to recetve the sto1en emat1s. There was hope the rootpnnt wou1d potnt to whtch state was responstbte, but that hope was not malmd as shown tn the tmage.
