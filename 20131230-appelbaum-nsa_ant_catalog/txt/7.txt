('I’SllSll’lREt.) SOUFFLETROUGH Persistence Implant Concept of Operations

(TSIISIUREL) SOUFFLETROUGH is a BIOS persistence implant for Juniper $56
500 and $56 300 series ﬁrewalls {320M 350M. 520. 550. 520M. 550M}. lt persists
DNT's BANANAGLEE software implant and modifies the Juniper ﬁrewall‘s operating
system (ScreenOS) at boot time. It BANANAGLEE support is not available for the
beeting operating system. it can install a Persistent Backdoor (PBD) designed to
work with BANANAGLEE's communications structure. so that full access can be
reacquired at a later time. It takes advantage of lntel‘s System Management Mode
for enhanced reliability and oovertness. The P130 is also able to beacon home. and
is fully conﬁgurable.

(TSIISIIIREL1A typical SOUFFLETROUGH deployment on a target ﬁrewall with an
exﬁltration path to the Remote Operations Center (ROC) is shown above.
SOUFFLETROUGH is remotely upgradeable and is also remotely installable
provided BANANAGLEE is already on the firewall of interest.

Status: (CIIREL) Released. Has been deployed. There are no Unit Cost: so
availability restrictions preventing ongoing deployments.
