TOP SECRETIICOMINTHREL TO USA. FVEY

 

(T SIISWREL TO USA.FVEY) Data RF retro-reflector. Provides return
modulated with target data (keyboard. low data rate digital device) when
illuminated with radar.

(U) Capabilities

(T SIISIIIREL T0 USAFVEY) SURLYSPAWN
has the capability to gather keystrokes without
requiring any software running on the targeted
system. it also only requires that the targeted
system be touched once. The retro-reflector is
compatible with both USB and P312 keyboards.
The simplicity of the design allows the form
factor to be tailored for specific operational
requirements. Future capabilities will include
laptop keyboards.

(U) Concept of Operation

(TSIISIIIREL TO USAFVEY) The board taps into the data line from the
keyboard to the processor. The board generates a square wave oscillating at
a preset frequency. The data-line signal is used to shift the square wave
frequency higher or lower. depending on the level oi the data-line signal. The
square wave. in essence. becomes frequency shift keyed (FSK). When the
unit is illuminated by a CW signal from a nearby radar. the illuminating signal
is amplitude-modulated (AM) with this square wave. The signal is re-radiated.
where it is received by the radar. demodulated. and the demodulated signal is
processed to recover the keystrokes. SURLYSPAWN is part oi the
ANGRYNEIGHBOR family of radar retro-reflectors.

Unit Cost: 530
