(T SIISIMREL) JETPLOW is a ﬁrmware persistence implant for Cisco PIX Series and
ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance) firewalls. It persists DNT‘s BANANAGLEE
software implant and modiﬁes the Cisco tirewall‘s operating system (08) at boot
time. It BANANAGLEE support is not available for the booting operating system. it
can install a Persistent Backdoor (PBD) designed to work with BANANAGLEE's
communications structure. so that full access can be reacquired at a later time.
JETPLOW works on Cisco's Silo-series PIX ﬁrewalls. as well as most ASA ﬁrewalls
(5505. 5510. 5520. 5540. 5550}.

(TSIISIIIREL) A typical JETPLOW deployment on a target ﬁrewall with an extiltration
path to the Remote Operations Center (ROC) is shown above. JETPLOW is
remotely upgradeable and is also remoter installable provided BANANAGLEE is
already on the ﬁrewall ol interest.

Status: (CIIREL) Released. Has been widely deployed. Current Unit Cost: so
availability restricted based on OS version (inquire for details).
