(T SllSlllREL] STUCCOMONTANA provides persistence for ONT implants. The
DNT implant will survive an upgrade or replacement oi the operating system «-
including physically replacing the router's compact ﬂash card.

(TS/[SI/IREL) Currently, the intended DNT Implant to persist is
VALIDATOR, which must be run as a user process on the target operating
system. The vector of attack is the modiﬁcation of the target's BIOS. The
modiﬁcation will add the necessary software to the BIOS and modify its
software to execute the STUCCOMONTANA Implant at the end of its native
System Management Mode (SMM) handler.

(TS/{SWREU STUCCOMONTANA must support all modern versions of
JUNOS, which is a version of FreeBSD customized by Juniper. Upon system
boot, the JUNOS operating system is modiﬁed in memory to run the
implant, and provide persistent kernel modifications to support implant
execution.

(‘I'SIISli'lRELi STUCCOMONTANA is the cover term for the persistence technique to
deploy a DNT implant to Juniper T-Series routers.
