(T SJISIHREL) TOTECHASER will use SMS messaging for the command. control.
and data extiltration path. The initial capability will use coven SMS messages to
communicate with the handset. These covert messages can be transmitted in
either Thuraya Satellite mode or GSM mode and will nor alert the user of this
activity. An alternate command and control channel using the GPRS data
connection based on the TOTEGHOSTLY implant is intended for a future version.

(TSJISINREL) Prior to deployment. the TOTECHASER handsets must be modified.
Details at how the phone is modified are being developed. A remotely deployable
TOTECHASER implant is being investigated. The TOTECHASER system consists
of the modified target handsets and a collection system.

(T SllSlHREL) TOTECHASER will accept configuration parameters to determine
how the implant operates. Configuration parameters will determine what information
is recorded. when to collect that information. and when the information is exfiltrated.
The conﬁguration parameters can be set upon initial deptoyment and updated
remotely.
