(TSHSI/IREL) HEADWATER PBD implant will be transferred remotely over
the internet to the selected target router by Remote Operations Center
(ROC) personnel. After the transfer process is complete, the P80 will be
installed in the router‘s boot ROM via an upgrade command. The 930 will
then be activated after a system reboot. Once activated, the ROC
operators will be able to use DNT's HAMMERMILL Insertion Tool (HIT) to
control the P80 as it captures and examines all IP packets passing through
the host router.

(TS/ISWREL) HEADWATER is the cover term for the P80 for Huawei
Technologies routers. PBD has been adopted for use in the joint NSAICIA
effort to exploit Huawei network equipment. (The cover name for this joint
project is TURBOPANDA.)

Status: (UIIFOUO) 0n the shell ready for deployment.
