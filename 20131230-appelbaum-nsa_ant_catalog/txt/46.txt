re-programmability. and covert communications with a host software implant over the USE.
The RF link will enable command and data inﬁltration and extiltration. CM-lll will also
communicate with Data Nehvork Technologies (ONT) software (STRNTBIZARRE) through a
covert channel implemented on the USB. using this communication channel to pass
commands and data between hardware and software implants. CM-lll will be a GENIE-
compliant implant based on CHIMNEYPOOL.

(‘l’srll'SlllREu CM-lll conceals digital components (TRINITY). a U58 2.0 HS hub. snatches.
and HOWLERMONKEY (HM) RF Transceiver within a R345 Dual Stacked USB connector.
CM+I has the ability to communicate to other CM devices over the RF link using an over-the-
air protocol called SPECULATION. CM-III can provide a short range inter-chassis link to
other CM devices or an intrachassis RF link to a long haul relay subsystem.
