(SitSlllREL) SIERRAMONTANA Concept of Operations

(TSHSIf/REL) Currently, the intended DNT Implant to persist is
VALIDATOR, which must be run as a user process on the target
operating system. The vector of attack is the modiﬁcation of the target's
8105. The modiﬁcation will add the necessary software to the BIOS and
modify its software to execute the SIERRAMONTANA implant at the end
of its native System Management Mode (SMM) handler.

(TS/ISU/REL) SIERRAMONTANA must support all modern versions of
JUNOS, which is a version of FreeBSD customized by Juniper. Upon
system boot, the JUNOS operating system is modiﬁed in memory to run
the implant, and provide persistent kernel modiﬁcations to support
implant execution.

(T SIISIIIREL) SIERRAMONTANA is the cover term for the persistence technique to
deploy a DNT implant to Juniper M-Series routers.
