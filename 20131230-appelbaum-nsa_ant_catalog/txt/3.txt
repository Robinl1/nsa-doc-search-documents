(SllStttREL) Persistence Operational Scenario . . . .
(TSIISUIREL) FEEDTROUGH can be used to persist two implants. ZESTYLEAK andlor . . .. -'
BANANAGLEE across reboots and software upgrades on known and covered 05's tor the .
I'ollowing Netscreen ﬁrewalls. nsSxt. nszs. nsSD. nsZOO. nsSDO and ISG 1000. There is no
direct communication to or from FEEDTROUGH. but it present. the BANANAGLEE implant . . .

can receive and transmit covert channel comms. and for certain pladorms. BANANAGLEE
can also update FEEDTROUGH. FEEDTROUGH however can onty persist 05's included ..
in it's databases. Therefore this is best employed with known 08's and it a new 05 comes
out. then the customer would need to add this 03 to the FEEDTROUGH database tor that
particular ﬁrewall.

(TSHSUIREL) FEEDTROUGH operates every time the particular Juniper firewall boots. The
ﬁrst hook takes it to the code which checks to see it the OS is in the database. it it is. then a
chain at events ensures the installation of either one or both implants. Otherwise the ﬁrewall
boots normally. It the OS is one modiﬁed by ONT. it is not recognized. which gives the
customer freedom to field new sottware.
