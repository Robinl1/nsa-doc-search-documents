(TS/lSI/IREL) Site Makes First-Ever Collect of High-Interest 4G Cellular Signal

FROM: _ and _

RAINFALL (F78)
Run Date: 02/23/2010

(TS/lSI/lREL) A collaborative effort between on-site collectors, engineers, and off-site
contractors in mid-January 2010 allowed RAINFALL to make what is believed to be the first
collection, by any known asset, of Time Division-Long Term Evolution (T D-LT E) 4G
(fourth generation) cellular communications. Exploitation of this signal, an all-Intemet
Protocol successor to 2G and 3G cellular systems, is a very high priority for NSA and the
Intelligence Community. The TD-LTE signal will enter the market in 2010 and become
globally important by 2012.
