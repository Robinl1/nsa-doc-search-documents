2.4. (U/lFOUO) Transmission

(UllFOUO) Session Announcements can be transmitted in several ways. These are:
0 Raw lP packet (T CPIUDPIICMP), sent to predetermined LP and port.
- TCP connection
- Steganographlc Tunnel

(UllFOUO) Using a raw lP packet, a single IP packet would be constructed where the SA would be
contained within the IP transport protocols payload. The IP and transport protocol (T CPlUDPllCMP)
would be constructed to route the packet to a predetermined destination IP address, IP protocol, and
for TCP/UDP the pon. number. This method provides no reliable transport. Note: Currently, only
UDP SA packets have been implemented.
