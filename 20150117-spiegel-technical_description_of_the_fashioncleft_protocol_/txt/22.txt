|3. (U/IFOUO) Packet Selection Algorithms

3.1. (U/lFOUO) Description

(SI/SI) This section describes the methods used to associate meta-data with non—
encapsulated egress packets that are transmitted independently from the data that is
desired to be exﬁltrated. Specifically, it addresses allowable contents for the "Packet-IIF—
Selector" and "Packet—I/F—Data" fields of the FOGYNULL Infrastructure Header (INF—HDR).
The following table identifies the specific values for the "Packet—IlF—Selector" field to
select which algorithm to be used to do an association. This indicates whether the
"Packet-IlF—Data" ﬁeld is used to convey parameters for the selected algorithm. The
"Packet—IlF—Data" field can be up to 32 bytes in length.

Value Algorithm Contents of Data

0x01 Generic Pattern Matching Matching rules
0x02 Fixed IP4 Field Matching Matching rules

 

 

 

 

 

(Ul/FOUO) All methods other than the null case contain associated "Packet-IlF—Data”.

The number and format of the bytes comprising the "Packet-l/F—Data" vary based on the
value of "Packet—I/F—Selector". However, to allow for cases in which a data receptor may
not understand a particular "Packet-IfF—Selector" value, the "Packet-IIF—Data" field will
always begin with a 1—byte field indicating the number of bytes in the "Packet—IlF—Data" ﬁeld
(excluding this 1-byte length ﬁeld). So, for the non—null types specified above, the
corresponding "Packet—IIF—Data" fields are as follows:

Length (1 byte) Data (1-31 bytes)

 

(SI/SI) Otherwise the contents of "Packet—IfF—Data" should be left as random data.

3.2.1 (U) None, [0x00]

(SI/SI) This represents the null case, i.e. the case in which there is no defined mapping association.
Hence no packets will be collected; only the metadata is forwarded. The content of “Packet-UF-
Data” is unused.
