(SI/SI) New encryption modes and options for encryption of data packets are added to the
FOGYNU LL authentication protocol, as shown in Table 2.1.2.22 The new values are
italicized and their cells are highlighted:

(SI/SI) lFASHIONC LEFT allows a new Exfil-Type 2 Packet. It was originalb/ proposed that
three new encryption modes would be used for Packet exfil, using the values 0x02 through
0x04; however, this proposed version was not actually implemented. Applying no
encryption is just what it implies. The term “munge” implies that privacy scrambling will be
applied to the data to make it a little less tractable to anyone trying to detect a third party
presence in the target system. The RCB/Composite mode uses full 128—bit encryption as
described in section 2.3.2.

(SI/SI) As implemented, lFASHIONCLEFT Packet exfil should always use Encryption
Mode 2 0x01 2 Default. The actual encryption mode used for Packet exfil is then specified
within the Metadata Block using SHELLGREY tags, as described in section 2.3.2.

2.1.3. (U/IFOUO) Payload (Content Information) Blocks

(Cl/SI) The payload (FUN NELAPS CNE protocol data) characterizing the contents of the
data packets is composed of two blocks — a 16—byte Exfil Header and a variable length
Metadata Block that conforms to the SHELLGREY CNE data protocol. There is no Exfil
Data block in this payload, and the contained data length is therefore reflected with a zero

length indicator in the Exfil Header.
