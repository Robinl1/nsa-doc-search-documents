1. No data packet has arrived for ten (10) minutes.
2. No SA has arrived for ten (10) minutes.

NEW OR CONTINUATION OF A TERMINATED SESSION

(UIIFOUO) When an authenticated SA arrives, the packet selection criteria, as well as the
FOGYNU LL Identification fields will be used to determine if the packet is new or existing
collection. If new the IFASHIONCLEFT receptor will begin data packet collection. If it is
redundant, the SA is ignored.

(UIIFOUO) If the SA that arrives is in actuality for a session that has been terminated, the
FASHIONCLEF receptor will be tasked to start data packet collection as if it was a new
session. The inner portion of the CDR will rejoin these disjoint captures of the same
session, by using the EXFIL_ID Meta—data tag and FOGYNULL identifiers, provided that
no more than fifteen (15) minutes between termination of the last session and the start of
the next session with the same EXFIL-ID from the implant.

(UIIFOUO) To insure separate session are not inadvertently joined by the CDR, Implants
should allow at least sixty (60) minutes, between the reuse of EXIL—ID values.

 

SENDING DATA PACKETS TO SESSION ANNOUNCEMENT PORTS

(UIIFOUO) To minimize testing every packet, for session announcements, being sent to
the FASHIONCLEFT receptor, only certain destination ports will be monitored for session
Announcements. These ports can be arbitrarily configured to address the needs of specific
deployed implants. If an implant chooses, or is required to by conditions imposed by the
target environment, it may send data packets to these ports as well. Packets that match a
data packet selection criterion are not checked for session announcements. Therefore,
implants that desire to send announcements to the same port as data packets, must
choose packet selection criteria carefully.

DUPLICATE DATA PACKETS

(UIIFOUO) Implants that desire to send duplicate data packets are permitted, and may be
desirable in some cases to insure that critical portions of the session are received by the
FASHIOINCLEFT receptor. Duplicate data packets will occur as an artifact of packet
sniffing by default. Data packets that are either duplicated by design or by coincidence
generally will be removed by post processing during session reconstruction.

SIMULTANEOUS EXFIL OF MULTIPLE SESSIONS

(UIIIFOUO) Implants that desire to exfiltrate multiple disjoint sessions simultaneously, or
even sessions back—to—back must utilize the EXFIL—ID in conjunction with the packet
selection criteria. The EXFIL—ID is used to identify disjoint sessions, while a packet
selection criterion is used to associate data packets to a particular session. Implants must
choose both such that both are unique per session, and the above conditions are met.
