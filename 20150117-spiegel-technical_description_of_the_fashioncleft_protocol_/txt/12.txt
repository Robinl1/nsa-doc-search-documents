2.1.3.1. (Cl/SI) Content of the Exfil Header
(SI/SI) The Exfil Header is a 16-byte block that contains the following fields:
Table 2.1.3.1-1 (S/Sl) Exfil Header

 

 

 

 

 

Byte: 0 1 2 3
0 Version (0x0001) Checksum
4 Metadata Length
8 Data Length ;_—. 0x00000000
12 Authentication

 

 

 

- Version: The version of this header.
- Checksum: A two byte CRC-16 checksum of the encoded Metadata Block.

- Metadata Length: A four byte unsigned integer in network byte order that represents the
number of bytes in the encoded Metadata Block (including any padding).

- Data Length: A four byte unsigned integer in network-byte order that represents the number of
bytes that comprises the Exﬁl Data block. The Data Length value used for FASHIONCLEFI'
must be 0 since there is no Exfil Data within the Session Announcement.

- Authentication: A copy of bytes 48-51 of the llmplant Header; a match validates the successful
decryption of the Exfil Header.

2.1.3.2. (U/IFOUO) Content of the Metadata Block

(TS/ISI) The metadata block, encoded according to the SHELLGREY metadata protocol
described in References [1 and 1.2] , contains the collection-related information and packet
reconstruction information. The required collection—related items are:

lExﬁl-ID [must be unique for {Implant|D, TargetID, DeploymentID, InstancelD}]

lExfil-Type [Packet or Session]

Time-of-Intercept
lFilter-I D

(TS/{SI} The reconstruction-related metadata was originally contained in the following
seven tags that show the original source and routing of the packets that were exfiltrated.
These tags are now provided only for informational purposes and are not used to
reconstruct the original packet:

0 Exfil-Sub—Type (optional field—0x01indicates the data type is VoIP—type
identifiers can be extended as necessary)

- IP4-Source—Addr
- IP4-Destination-Addr
- IP4-Source-Port
