IP—Sub—Protocol (as defined by the IP protocol)

(TS/ISI) Reconstruction is now explicitly specified using SH ELLGREY reconstruction tags
such as (see reference [1.2] for a complete list):

PACKET_BIT_REPLACE
PACKET_BIT_REPLACE_I P4
PACKET_BYTE_REMOVE
PACKET_BYTE_REMOVE_I P4
PACKET_BYTE_REPLACE
PACKET_BYTE_REPLACE_I P4
PACKET_IP_ADDR

(TS/ISI) SHELLGREY reconstruction and decryption tags (section 2.3.2) are processed in
the order in which they occur. The reconstruction result is therefore highly dependent on
the specific reconstruction tags used and the order in which they occur. This flexibility
allows the sender (the implant) to specify how to transform the exfiltrated data and the
receiver simply follows instructions without needing any knowledge of custom/proprietary
data formats.

2.2. (U/lFOUO)Encryption/Decryption/Validation

(TS/ISI) All communication will be encrypted with the appropriate level of encryption for
the information, transmission medium, and target system. RSA public keys are used to encrypt
Session Announcement Infrastructure and Implant Headers; decryption is performed using RSA
private keys. R06 block ciphers are used to encrypt the Session Announcement Exfil Header
and Metadata Block, and optionally Data Packets, using the R06 Session Key and Message
Indicators contained within the Session Announcement Implant Header.

(TS/ISI) The FLASHHANDLE Mission Management (FMM) system is the database
resource for generatinglretaining crypto keys and other information (e.g. Implantld's, Targetld's).
All Session Announcements must have two 128—byte RSA—encrypted header blocks. The
Infrastructure and Implant Header blocks are encrypted using the RSA—128 algorithm. Metadata
blocks and (optionally) Data Packets are encrypted using the RC6—16 algorithm in Output
Feedback Mode (OFB). See the Key Management diagram below.
