Classification: Top Secret ll COMINT fl X1

(SI/SIIIX1) The CDR Architecture includes the Outer SURPASSPIN, Inner SU RPASSPIN
and SEAGULLFARO subsystems. In addition, a one—way transfer device — ROOTKNOT
(composed of Pitcher, Catcher, and their one—way link) — supplants the air gap previously
employed (that required manual transfer by diskette). In order to support this configuration,
DNT has been working closely with the Remote Operations Center (R00) to design and
build FIGBUILD (an external mission network) and OPTICPINCH (an internal mission
network).

(SI/SI) Figure 1.3—1 below shows the Common Data Receptor Architecture as described in
the referenced FLAXENPRECEPT ElCDs.

(SI/SI) The interfaces supported by the CDR must also support the CDR’s separation of
classiﬁed and unclassified processing. Classified information, such as egress data and
metadata must be protected while on the unclassified network side before passing through
the one—way link. This interface also supports the CDR protection of classified information.

(U/IFOUO) Interface Description

(SI/SI) This interface provides TAO developers a low overheard solution to exfiltrate
streaming data, typically associated with implants that collect raw packets from the target
environment, while providing the appropriate metadata and authentication. The basic
design principle behind this low overhead approach is to redirect a copy or clone of the
original packet to another host, or listening post (in this case the CDR). In—order to redirect
a packet, features of the copy of the packet must be altered — particularly the source and
destination addresses, and possibly the port numbers.
