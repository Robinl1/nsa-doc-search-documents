1. (U) Introduction

1.1 (U) Document Description

(SI/SI) This document defines the IFASHIONCLEFT Computer Network Exploitation (CNE)
collection protocol that enables raw data packets from the external Internet to interface to
the Common Data Receptor (CDR) of Data Network Technology’s (DNT’s) Common
System Architecture (CSA). This interface will be deployed to support Tailored Access
Operations (TAO) On—Net operations, specifically implants that are required to exfiltrate
collected network packets, but due to implant processing and bandwidth constraints are
required to utilize a low overhead egress protocol.

(SI/SI) This document defines the interface requirement that the Common Data Receptor
and implant must support to enable successful reception of raw data packets sent by the
implant. It includes conceptual data flow diagrams and network diagrams to define the
system. It also contains detailed data format examples, data field definitions, and a
description of the protocol.

1.3 (U) Background

(SI/SI) The Common Data Receptor (CDR) is a DNT-designed system to perform the data
reception portion of what is commonly termed a ‘Listening Post.’ The CDR supports a
common interface that DNT developers use for data formatting and reception. In addition,
the Common Data Receptor concept emphasizes the use of a Data Receptor, Operations
Manager, and Network Manager vice a Listening Post.

(SI/SIIIX1) The introduction of the FASHIONCLEFT protocol is necessary because without
the FASHIONCLEFT protocol, the implant—to—CDR communication previously did not
handle raw IP data packets. In addition, an implant previously had no way to deal with the
challenge of processing streaming data while minimizing the computing overhead
associated with encapsulating and encrypting the data. This new protocol provides the
developer a mechanism to specify the level of encryption implemented in the implant as a
precursor to data transmission.

(Sl/SI/le) The FASHIONCLEFT protocol supports the passing of metadata securely and
with authentication.

(SI/SIIIX1) The metadata is used to support the reconstruction of IP packets and when
applicable to convey information about the session.
