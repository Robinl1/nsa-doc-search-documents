Numerous target offices have complained about this collection ”diluting” their workflow. One argument for keeping it is that it
provides a retrospective look at target activity — this argument is hampered by a) the unreliable and non-understood nature of when
the transfer occurs for an account, and b) that FISA restrospective collection would retrieve the exact same data ”on demand".

SSO Optimization believes that while this is ”valid" collection of content, the sheer volume and the age — coupled with the
unpredictable nature of Narchive activity — makes collecting older data a less desirable use of valuable resources. 59% of Narchive
email collected was originally sent and received more than 180 days after collection. This represents about 8.9 GB a day of ”less
desirable" collection — long term allocation that could be easily filled with more timely, useful H from this lucrative 550 site. As
always with our optimization, the data would still be available at the site store for SIGDEV. This would not impact metadata
extraction.
