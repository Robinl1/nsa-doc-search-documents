GW— —TargetManager responds t6 loadTargets request
from CoreSSC, pulls the GW IP addresses from the
Targeting database; issues control—flow messages
for each IPzPort combination and sends periodic
updates for those.

FCP responds to control—flow messages by
promoting all packets to/from the targeted IP:port
combinations, and PacketRouter ensures these
packets are sent to GW—FIP for sessionization. GW—
FIP outputs 'raw' SOTF session—fragments to the
TE—GW service on the same host.

GW-SessionFilter identifies sessions containing
target technology—of—interest by applying an
appropriate appld tag to each session—fragment.
GW—FragmentFilter removes session—fragments not
containing an appropriate appld for the target
technology—of—interest. Additionally, as a work—
around for an issue in FIP 3.1.10, erroneous
session—fragments missing a specific metadata
filed are removed. GW—MI applies SRI obtained
from Dfid Allocator.

EGWEMI applies SRI obtained from the DFID

allocator.
