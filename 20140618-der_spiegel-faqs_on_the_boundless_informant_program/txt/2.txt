(U//FOUO) Strategic Managers seeking to understand top level metrics at the
organization/ofﬁce level or seeking to answer data calls on NSA collection capability.

(U//FOUO) Analysts looking for additional sites to task for coverage of a particular
technology within a specific country.

What are the different views?

(U//FOUO) mp View — The Map View is designed to allow users to view overall DNI, DNR, or
aggregated collection posture of the agency or a site. Clicking on a country will show the collection
posture (record counts, type of collection, and contributing SIGADs or sites) against that pa1ticular
country in addition to providing a graphical display of record count trends. In order to bin the records
into a country, a normalized phone number (DNR) or an administrative region atom (DNI) must be
populated within the record. Clicking on a site (within the Site Speciﬁc view) will show the viewshed
for that site — what countries the site collects against.

(U//FOUO) Org View — The Organization View is designed to allow users to view the metadata record
counts by organizational structure (i.e. GAO — SSO — RAM-A— SPINNERET) all the way down to the
cover term. Since it’s not necessary to have a normalized number or administrative region populated,
the numbers in the Org View will be higher than the numbers in the Map View.

(U//FOUO) Similarity View — The Similarity View is currently a placeholder view for an upcoming

feature that will graphically display sites that are similar in nature. This can be used to identify areas
for a de-duplication effort or to inform analysts of additional SIGADs to task for queries (similar to

Amazon’s “if you like this item, you’ll also like these” feature).

(U) Where do you get your data?

(U//FOUO) BOUNDLESSINFORMANT extracts metadata records from GM-PLACE post-
FALLOUT (DNI ingest processor) and post-TUSKATTIRE (DNR ingest processor). The records are
enriched with organization information (e. g. 550, FORNSAT) and cover term. Every valid DNT and
DNR metadata record is aggregated to provide a count at the appropriate level. See the different views
question above for additional information.

(U) Do you have all the data? What data is missing?
(U//FOUO) The tool resides on GM-PLACE which is only accredited up to
TS//SI//NOFORN. Therefore, the tool does not contain ECI or FISA data.
(U//FOUO) The Map View only shows counts for records with a valid normalized number
(DNR) or administrative region atom (DNI).
(U//FOUO) Only metadata records that are sent back to NSA-W through FASCIA or

FALL OUT are counted. Therefore, programs with a distributed data distribution system (e. g.
MUS CULAR and Terrestrial RF) are not currently counted.

(U//FOUO) Only SIGINT records are currently counted. There are no ELINT or other “INT”
records included.

(U) Why are you showing metadata record counts versus content?
(U//FOUO)

(U) Do you distinguish between sustained collect and survey collect?
(U//FOUO) The tool currently makes no distinction between sustained collect and survey collect. This
feature is on the roadmap.
