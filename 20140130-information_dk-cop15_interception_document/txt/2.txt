(TS//SI//REL) Given such large participation (with all 192 UN member states invited to attend),

their counterparts -- details of which are of great interest to our policymakers. While the outcome
of the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference remains uncertain, signals intelligence will
undoubtedly play a signiÔ¨Åcant role in keeping our negotiators as well informed as possible
throughout the 2-week event.
