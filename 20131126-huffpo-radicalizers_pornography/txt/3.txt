(T Ss'f-“SL‘I'REL TO USA, FVEY) Examining how the six radicalizers establish and maintain access with diﬂ’erent pools of people susceptible to
their message -- and their perceptions of the difﬁculties in doing so -- suggests that there are wherabiliﬁes that can be exploited in terms of this
access: and emerging radicalizers ma}r be vulnerable on this point as well. Focusing on access reveals potential wlnerabililies that could be even
more eﬂ‘ectivel}r exploited when used in combination with wlnerabilities of character or credibility: or both, of the message in order to shape the
perception of the messenger as well as that of his followers.
