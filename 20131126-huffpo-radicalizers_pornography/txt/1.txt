PREFACE (U)

(T S-“s’SI-‘V'REL TO USA, FVEYWFISA) This SIGINT assessment examines access as one element in the process of Islamic radicalization in order
to identify uﬂnerabilities. Using six prominent, globally-resonating foreign radicalizers as exemplars, this report focuses on the means they use to
reach their intended audience and reveals potential wlnerabilities for exploitation. It should be read in conjunction with NSA report 3.-"RA-"501518-
Q , which identiﬁes mﬂnerabilities of authority.

(T SITE-"REL T0 USA, FVEY) Information herein is based largely on Sunni extremist communications and includes disseminated SIGI'NT as
well as collateral available between January 2008 and September 2012. The SIGINT information is ﬁom primary sources with direct access and is
generally considered reliable. Greater specificity on the SIGINT sourcing is provided in the text. Included in the appendix are charts on ways that
access has been aﬂ‘ected and countermeasures taken; a comparison of radicalizers' access mechanisms; and a matrix that compares their authority,
argument, countries where they resonate, and their personal winerabilities.
