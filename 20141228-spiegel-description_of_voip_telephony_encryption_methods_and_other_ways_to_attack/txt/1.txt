VoIP NSA alias

From GCWiki
Jump to: navigation. search

SAMESHEET is a group for discussing media over packet in the SIGINT community.
It initially dealt with just VOIR but has expanded its scope. These notes get mailed
out after each monthly meeting (usually held the third Wednesday of every month.)
Look for reminders, calls for Agenda items, and notes on the voip@nsa alias. This
alias can be joined at: L11

This GCHQ record of SAMESHEET meetings is ended in favour of NSA's
version at: [.21.

I encourage all those who have an interest to join NSA's alias directly.
