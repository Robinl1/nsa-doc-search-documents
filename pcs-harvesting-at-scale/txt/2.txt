Summary

Individual Subscriber Authentication Keys, or Ki values, are required to decrypt GSM
communications. They are stored both on the mobile user’s SIM card and at a Home Location
Register operated by the provider. TDSD has developed a methodology for intercepting these
keys as they are transferred between various network operators and SIM card providers. This

is now a core part of TDSD’s business carried out by analysts in the team. This report
explores the introduction of an automated technique with the aim of increasing the volume of
keys that can be harvested. Methods are also explored to use data from the automated system

to assess the effectiveness of current techniques and improve TDSD ’s knowledge of mobile
network operations.
