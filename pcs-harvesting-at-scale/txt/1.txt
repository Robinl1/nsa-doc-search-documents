This report explores the introduction of an automated approach to Ki harvesting in OPC-
TDSD with the aim of increasing the volume of keys that can be collected. Methods are also
explored to use data from the automated system to assess the effectiveness of current
techniques and improve TDSD’s knowledge of mobile network operations. Work was carried
out between January and April 2010 in OPC-TDSD and UPC-CAP.
