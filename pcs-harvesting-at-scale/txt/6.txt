Figure 1 - Manual Ki
Harvesting Process

Analysts in the team regularly perform queries on targeted C2C intercept using UDAQ. A
number of queries exist designed to return results likely to contain IMSI and Ki values.
Queries often return results with a high noise threshold ~ of several thousand results perhaps a
few hundred will contain items of value. The next stage is to trawl these results for items of
value. If a list of IMSI and Ki values is found this can be copied from the tool and sent on to
UPC-CAP for further processing. In the best case lists of several hundred thousand Kis
associated with IMSI values can be found. However, a large number of messages each contain
only a few associated Ki values. The responsibility of converting IMSUKi lists into a storable
form lies with UPC-CAP; TDSD analysts can only spend limited time manipulating the
layout of data before forwarding.
