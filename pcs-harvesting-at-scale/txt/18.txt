prioritise items found. Additionally, the accuracy of results could be improved by
detecting only LMSIs with valid country and network codes.

I Bulk access limitations
The maximum classification that can be returned from LLANDARCYPARK is TOP
SECRET STRAPZ UK Eyes Only. This limits access to some data likely to contain
IMSI and Ki values, such as password-recovered items. An improved system would
allow bulk access to the full range of data.

I Adapting technique to be used for other key types
This technique currently identifies only M51 and Ki values. In time it should be
extended to also support efforts against OTA keys, UMTS and more.

I Data mining opportunities
Opportunities exist to mine bulk data produced during this process, potentially
detecting further items of interest and developing knowledge of targets involved.
Proposed ideas include detecting requests for batches of data by identifying
messages containing maximum and minimum SLM values.

I Corporate support for bulk CZC processing
Access to ICTR’s bulk access capability is restricted to a small number of users,
however a number of business units have expressed an interest. This work should
continue to be used to develop requirements for a corporate solution allowing more
business units to benefit from these types of techniques.
