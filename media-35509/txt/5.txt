TOP SECRET STRAPl

 

Connectivity (Dataflows)

 

 

The success of the cryptanalytic services experiment relies on the ability to extract
and pass crypto-synch parameters associated with common internet encryption
technologies to NSAW/LONGHAUL for cryptanalytic attack and recovery. The crypto-
synch parameters are extracted in the cryptanalytic processing servers and passed to
NSAWILONGHAUL via a corporate messaging system (ISLANDTRANSPORT)
connection. The messages are encrypted prior to leaving the cryptanalytic processing
servers using the secure corporate messaging software (ISLANDHIDEAWAY) for
security and authentication.

 

 

Data Requirements

 

 

This experiment will leverage and validate candidate input streams (case notations)
containing the common internet encryption technologies of interest.
