(U) MHS Leverages XKS for QUANTUM Against Yahoo and Hotmail

(TSHSIHREL) MHS Leverages XKEYSCORE Deep—Dive Packet Analysis to Identify Feasibility of QUANTUM Against Yahoo and Hotmail
(TSHSIHREL) Automated deep packet analysis onahoo and Hotmail providers gives keen insight into the potential success ofOUANTUMTHEORY exploitation against these services.

(TSHSIHREL) OUANTUMTHEORY is a set of CNO man-on-the-side capabilities that involves real-time packet inject in response to passive collection oftarget communications. OUANTUMTHEORY
inspects each packet. one at a time. for a set of keywords that determine if the packet originated from a CNE target and ifa modiﬁed response to that packet might result in exploitation of the client
computer. Because each packet is inspected individually. if keywords occur across packet boundaries the OUANTUMTHEORY technique will not tip the SIGINT system to attempt exploitation of a
client. As HTTP headers and the size of cookies grows. the likelihood of all keywords occurring within a single packet reduces. MHS analysts. in collaboration with XKEYSCORE and the ROC,
productized DRAGGABLEKITTEN. an XKEYSCORE Mapreduce analytic that leverages the packets collected and made accessible to analytics by XKEYSCORE DEEPDIVE systems.
DRAGGABLEKITTEN identiﬁes the OUANTUMTHEORY keywords in a packet capture and generates statistics for each service (currently Hotmail and Yahoo] to determine how often a|| ofthe
keywords occur within a single packet. This would not have been possible without XKEYSCORE providing a platform for analysis to mass-deploy packet-level processing. Approximately 50% of

Hotmail and 90% onahoo sessions contain thmvwords necessary within a sinole packet to be taroeted bv QUANTUMTHEORY
