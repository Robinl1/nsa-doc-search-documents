What is TOR?

- “The Onion Router”

- Hides source of traffic by passing encrypted

versions of your internet traffic between multiple
TOR routers

- Notation:

— “Client" — the initiator of communication
— “Guard node" — the TOR router the client contacts

— “Exit node" — the TOR router that relays your traffic to
the final destination (with no extra encryption so this
link can be exploited by SIGINT system)
