UK TOP SECRET STRAP1 COMINT
Scoring: refinements

- There may be an unknown time-offset
— Traffic takes time to relay through the TOR network
— SIGINT clocks may not be synchronised

— We slide the traces against each other and find the best
match

— Truncate to exit node trace (we know that it is a
complete TOR circuit)
