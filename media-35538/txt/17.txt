UK TOP SECRET STRAP1 COMINT
False positives

Want an algorithm with very low false positive rate

Used 2 hours of (timestamp, source IP, destination
IP) tuples captured from 4 106 internet bearers

Filtered to tuples between a guard node and a non-
TOR node

Allow time to arbitrarily slide +/- 2 hours
— In real redeployment one would restrict this slide

Allow us to plot ROC curves for the technique
