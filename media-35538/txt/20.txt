UK TOP SECRET STRAP1 COMINT

- We are collecting the required logs of packet
times with TOR guard nodes in SIGINT

- GTE / JTRIG have adapted some TOR exit nodes
we own to collect the required exit node data

— We are keen to engage with others with exit nodes too

° Then run the attack
— Expect to basically work

— Some extra work might be required to only allow
queries on sessions with enough structure
° Need the bulk data first to progress this question
