TOP 8 ECR ETIISIIINO FORN

(U) Success Stories

(Si/Sl/IREL TO USA, SAU) NSA's work with TAD on a sensitive access has
shown early promise in producing SIGINT ofvalue to the CT product line.

(SIISIIIREL TO USA, SAU) A modernized HFDF sensor and HFDF antenna
system was installed in September 2012 at a MOD RRD location new Riyadh.
This H FDF system replaces a legacy sensor that has been inoperable for an
extended period oftime and will signiﬁcantly improve NSA's regional HFDF
architecture.

(SIISIIIREL TO USA SAU) MOD RRD supported a Quick Reaction _Capabium
that deployed a —system

the Arabian Gulf In response to a potential threat from IRGC QODS Maritime
Force. A sustained collection platform is planned for deployment in May 2013.

(U) ProblemlehaIIenges with the Partner

(SIISIIIREL TO USA, FVEY) The MOD RRD would like to move expeditiously in
their modernization efforts, to include the acquisition of additional SIGINT
capabilities. NSAICSS is cautiously moving forward with this partner and is not
necessarily ready to move forward with initiatives that expose sensitive NSAICSS
SIGINT equities. This difference in strategic direction will sometimes be
problematic and cause tension within the partnership.

(Si/SI/INF) NSA/CSS has agreed to coordinate collection operations in Saudi
Arabia with Chief of Station of Riyadh in an effort to protect unilateral HUMINT
assets from scrutiny.

(TS/ISIIINF) NSA/CSS does not expect the new relationship with TAD to usurp or
negatively impact NSAICSS’ existing relationship with the Ministry of Defense
Radio Reconnaissance Department (MOD RRD), as MOD RRD does not have
similar access to internal Saudi telecommunications.
