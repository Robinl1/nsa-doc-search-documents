(SIISIIIR EL TO USA, SAU) Subject: NSA Intelligence Relationship with
Saudi Arabia

(U) Introduction

(TSHSIHN F) Since the ﬁrst Gulf War in 1991, NSAICSS has had a very limited
SIGINT relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The SIGINT
relationship has been solely with the Ministry of Defense, Radio Reconnaissance
Department (MOD RRD) which is the ﬁrst of three ministry-level organizations
that have a role in the defense and security of the Kingdom. The NSAICSS
SIGINT relationship with the MOD RRD is a complex and challenging one that,
after several years of stagnation, is experiencing a period of rejuvenation.
NSAICSS is in the process of modernizing the MOD RRD High Frequency
Direction Finding (HFDF) capability that assists in the monitoring of Iranian
military threats to KSA. NSAICSS’ Middle EastIAfrica (M EA) and
Counterterrorism (CT) Product Lines provide threat warning against terrorist
targets and targets of interest to the KSA, speciﬁcally, intelligence related to
Huthi conﬂicts along the SaudiIYem en border.

(TSIISIIIR EL TO USA, SAU) On 11 December 2012, the Director of National
Intelligence (DNI) approved expansion of NSA's Third Party SIGINT relationship
with Saudi Arabia to include the Saudi Ministry of Interior's (MOI) Technical
Affairs Directorate (TAD). Prior to receiving DNl's approval of the relationship and
under the auspices of ClA’s relationship with the MOl’s Mabahith (General
Directorate for Investigations, equivalent to FBI), NSA had been collaborating
with TAD since February 2011 on a sensitive access initiative. This capability is
focused on internal security and terrorist activity on the Arabian Peninsula. \Mth
the approval ofthe Third Party SIGINT relationship, NSAICSS intends to provide
direct analytic and technical support to TAD.

(TSIISIIIR EL TO USA, FVEY) Lastly, using the Foreign Release Process,
NSAICSS shares threat warning and terrorist lead information produced by the
Counterterrorism Product Line with the CIA Station in Riyadh to pass to ClA’s

intelligence partner the KSA Ministry of Interior Directorate of Investigations,
Mabahith.
