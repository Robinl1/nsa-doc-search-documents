(U) Key Issues

(TSHSIHREL TO USA, FVEY) MOD RRD is interested in expanding the
relationship with NSAICSS. The MOD RRD seeks signals analysis equipment
upgrades, decryption capabilities and advanced training on a wide range of
topics. While NSAICSS is able to respond to many of their requests, some must
be denied due to the fact that they place sensitive SIGINT equities at risk.

(TSIISIIIN F) NSAICSS leadership anticipates a spring 2013 visit to Saudi Arabia
to meet with TAD leadership to discuss current and future initiatives of mutual
interest under the new relationship construct. NSA’s primary goals for the
partnership are:

1) (SIISIIIREL TO USA, SAU) to leverage Saudi Arabia's strategic location
and unique access to communications - e.g. al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula
(AQAP) terrorist activity currently not accessible by other means, and

2) (TSIISIIIR EL TO USA, SAU) to facilitate the Saudi government's ability
to utilize SIGINT to locate and track individuals of mutual interest within Saudi
Arabia.

(SIISIIIR EL TO USA, SAU) NSAICSS provides technical advice on SIGINT topics
such as data exploitation and target development to TAD as well as a sensitive
source collection capability.

(SIISIIIR EL TO USA, SAU) NSAICSS provides a sensitive decryption service to
the Ministry of Interior against terrorist targets of mutual interest.

(U) What Partner Provides to NSA

geography in the Arabian Gulfbut provides no ﬁnished SIGINT reporting to
NSAICSS, however; they have provided unencrypted collection against the IRGC
QODS Maritime Force targets of mutual interest from their collection system-
