Ads: Mobclix

 

 

WSJ: Mobclix, the ad exchange, matches more than 25 ad networks
with some 15,000 apps seeking advertisers. The Palo Alto, Calif.,
company collects phone IDs, encodes them (to obscure the number
), and assigns them to interest categories based on what apps
people download and how much time they spend using an app,
among other factors. By tracking a phone's location, Mobclix also
makes a ‚Äùbest guess" of where a person lives, says Mr. Gurbuxani,
the Mobclix executive. Mobclix then matches that location with
spending and demographic data from Nielsen Co.
