(UIIFOUO) R22 Continues Collaboration with NSA CTOITS via Secure
Tokens Talk

(Uf/FOUO) The Information Assurance Engineering Research Office (R22) is continuing a
collaboration initiative with the NSA/CTO Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and
Chief Information Officer (CIO) Staff (TS) through an exchange of ideas via TS—sponsored
technical talks. R22’s objective is to assist T8 with improving the security of critical IT
systems as well as obtaining feedback and information on emerging hard problems to consider
for future research. In addition, the regular exchange with TS helps connect R22 researchers
to a potential new base of customers and partners.

(Uf/EOUO)_ the R223 lead researcher for secure tokens discovery, presented on
8 August 2008 at the TS Technical Talk Forum. His discussion centered on the Tokens
Research Roadmap, the current status of development efforts underway through partnerships
with IAD, and current utilization of interim capabilities on CES laptops. TS personnel and
other Agency representatives who deal with tokens/smartcards responded positively and
launched a dialogue on many issues that encompassed operations, policy, technical transfer,
and productization challenges. While there were different implementation issues raised for a
variety of customer sets, the common end vision is an assured identity token in a smartcard
format. The R223 token research program is in line with this vision and all capabilities will
be compatible and can be transferred onto a smartcard format. Both DOD and IC customer
needs are addressed as a part of the R223—led research strategy.
