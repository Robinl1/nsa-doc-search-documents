(UIIFOUO) R23 Contributes Behavioral Anomaly Detection to IDAICCS
DISTILLERY SCAMP

(TS/1r SI/lREL) The 2008 Summer Conference on Applied Mathematical Problems (SCAMP)
was hosted this summer in Bowie, MD at the IDAICCS. This SCAMP focused on a specific
category of attacks and intrusions targeted against US. critical national infrastructure.
Commonly known in the DoD community as the BYZANTINE HADES (BH) attacks, these
intrusions are believed to originate from the People’s Republic of China. The main goals of
the SCAMP were to define and implement novel behavioral-based techniques that could
better detect and respond to the wide array of BH attacks. R23’s POPQUIZ framework
provided the analytical applications to identify behavioral anomalies while DISTILLERY
provided the stream-based platform from which to execute these applications.

(Uf/FOUO) A key factor to the success of the SCAMP was the availability of the SPADE
programming language. Developed by IBM, SPADE enables the rapid development and
prototyping of distributed stream-processing applications. Utilizing this language requires
little programming expertise, as applications are described using high-level stream-centric
constructs. A compiler handles the conversion of this description into native DISTILLERY
application. The SCAMP participants, the majority having had little experience developing
DISTILLERY applications, were able to quickly compose unique and complex applications.
By not having to expend time learning a new low-level API, participants were able to focus
their efforts on defining and implementing new detection techniques and methodologies.

(UIIFOUO) HAIRBALL Deploys GraphViz for POPEYESEAR: Visualization
Techniques for Computer Network Defense

(Uf/FOUO) On 12 August 2008 the R23 HAIRBALL project deployed its GraphViz v1.0
visualization tool to the NTOC floor as an addition to the POPEYESEAR interface.
Following the deployment of TreeViz in Nov 2007, GraphViz is the second visualization tool
deployed for operational use. The achievement reflects the ongoing research investment in
new visualization techniques uniquely designed to support exploration and analysis of
Computer Network Defense (CND) data.

(Uf/FOUO) GraphViz displays relationships from POPEYESEAR data as an interactive graph
with dynamic, analyst-directed navigation. The dynamic navigation empowers analysts to
locate subsets of the large POPEYESEAR database that are most relevant to their analysis.
The graph-based display enables analysts to more easily perceive the connections existing in
the data.

(Uf/FOUO) GraphViz has been built with an eye towards usability and rapid response. The
interface provides Coogle-like search syntax and intuitive point-and-click control. Under the

hood, the use of data preprocessing and indexing enables GraphViz to return results with
