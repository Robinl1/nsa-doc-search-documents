Effects Capability

.‘JTRIG develop the majority of effects capability in GCHQ. A lot of this capability is developed on demand for specific operations and then further
developed to provide weaponised capability.

Dont treat this like a catalogue. If you dont see it here, it doesnt mean we cant build it. If you involve the JTRIG operational teams at the start of your
operation, you have more oi a chance that we will build something foryou.

For each oi our tools we have indicated the state oi the tool. We only advertise tools here that are either ready to fire or very close to being ready
(operational requirements would re-prioritise our development). Once again, involve the JTRIG operational teams early.
