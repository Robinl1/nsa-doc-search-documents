[UHFDUD] History.r has been made: for the first time ever
SID; ADET and FAD personnel collaborated to create an
analytic course for NBA Third Part3.r partners.
"Introduction to SIGDEV‘“ was held at the European
Technical Center [ETG] in Wiesbadeni German}r and
taught to 25 students from SSEUR nationsﬁ‘ 14-15
September EDID.

[SHREL] The course provided the SSEUR partners with
a common understanding ofthe importance of SIGINT
Development [SIGDEV] as a discipline; and a common
definition of'SIGDE‘vr efforts. This effort enhanced the
opportunities for SSEUR partners to work together more
effectivelyr to tackle mission areas of mutual interest --
especiallyr Afghanistan and Gounterterrorism [GT] target
sets.

[UHFDUD] The training was extremelyr successful; based
on survejpr responses; and man}r of the partners plan to
incorporate information from this course into training
programs for their own new SIGINT analvsts.

[UHFDUD] SID; ADET and FAD are currentlyr creating
another more in-depth telephonyr analvsis training course
with the hopes of presenting this training to NBA Third
Part3.r partners in springfsummer EDI].
