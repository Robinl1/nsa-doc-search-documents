Protective Marking Guidance

The following offers some guidance on Protective Markings (PM) for
BULLRUN material. Questions regarding PMs can be directed to the Col
Authority’s delegates.

At SECRET STRAP1 COMINT AUSCANZUKUS EYES :

The fact that GCHQ has unspecified capabilities against network security
technologies eg TLS/SSL, HTTPS, SSH, VPNs, lPSec. NB capability does not
necessarily equate to decryption capability.

At TOP SECRET STRAP1 COMINT AUSCANZUKUS EYES :

The fact that GCHQ or its 2nd Party partners has some capability against the
encryption used in a class or type of network communications technology. For
example, VPNs, lPSec, TSL/SSL, HTTPS, SSH, encrypted chat, encrypted
VolP.

At TOP SECRET STRAP2 COMINT BULLRUN AUSCANZUKUS EYES :

The fact that GCHQ or a 2nd Party partner has a capability against a specific
encrypted network security technology — see Annexe for details. (At a
minimum, specific capabilities may be protected by additional ECls and
restriction on “Eyes".)

The fact that GCHQ or its partners exploits specific encrypted network
communications — see Annexe for details. (At a minimum, specific capabilities
may be protected by additional ECls and restriction on “Eyes".)

Decrypts (plaintext or derived events / metadata) obtained from BULLRUN
capabilities. (At a minimum, specific capabilities may be protected by
additional restriction on “Eyes" and, in a few cases, additional ECls.)

GLOSSARY

(U) HTTPS — HTTP traffic secured inside an SSL/TLS session, indicated by
the https:// URL, commonly using TCP port 443

(U) lPSEC -- lPSec, or IP Security, is the Internet Engineering Task Force

(IETF) standard for layer 3 real-time communication security. lPSec allows
two hosts (or two gateways) to establish a secure connection, sometimes

called a tunnel. All traffic is protected at the network layer.

AUSCANZUKUS EYES stands for Australia, Canada,
New Zealand, United Kingdom and United States, i.e.,
Five Eyes.
