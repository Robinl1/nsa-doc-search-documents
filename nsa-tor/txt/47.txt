to them. Once a server is appended to an “Establish Rend” circuit, its purpose becomes
“Rend Ready” (a one—hop circuit to a rendezvous point) and attempting to append any
more servers will cause a crash. This will need to be cleaned up as functionality for creating
rendezvous circuits and accessing hidden services is added.

F.3 (TS/ / SI) DOS-style attacks

(TS / / SI) The GUI provides an interface for performing the coil and ﬂower DoS attacks
from the MJOLNIR library. In the coil attack, the user chooses two servers to attack and
the number of coils in the circuit. Each server appears once in the circuit for each coil, so
the length of the circuit will be twice the number of coils. For the ﬂower attack, the user
chooses a server to attack and the number of petals, where the number of petals is the
number of times the selected server will appear in the circuit.

(TS / / SI) For both attacks, the user has the option to create the coil or ﬂower as a
new circuit or to append it to an existing circuit. However, appending coils or ﬂowers is
more expensive than creating them as new circuits, and there is a signiﬁcant performance
hit for appending large coils and ﬂowers to circuits.

F.4 (TS / / SI) Sending arbitrary packets

(TS / / SI) To send a packet through a circuit, the user ﬁrst clicks the “Send Packet” button.
Then the user selects a circuit to send the message through, and an IP address and port
number to send the message to. The user has the option of entering the payload of the
packet in either hex or ASCII. Upon clicking “Send”, the packet is encrypted with the
appropriate layers of encryption and sent through the circuit. The exit server will then
send the decrypted packet to the selected IP address and destination port.
