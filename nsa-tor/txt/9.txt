Table 1: (U) Tor’s X.509 certiﬁcate

Version: 3 (0x2) This is hard—coded into Tor.

Serial Number: some number Currently, we don’t know if this is a random
number, or if there is some signiﬁcance. (We do know that it is created with an
OpenSSL function.)

SignatureAlgorithm: shalWithRSAEncryption

Issuer: O=TOR CN=string <identity> “TOR” will always be present as the
organizationName. The commonName ﬁeld is more variable. string will be the nick—
name of the server as listed in the public directories. For clients without nicknames,
it will be the string “client”. Note that it will always be followed by “ <identity>”.

Validity:
— Not Before: time This is the time that the TLS certiﬁcate was created by
TOR.
— Not After: time By default, this is 2 hours later.
Subject: O=TOR CN=string Again, “TOR” is the organizationName. This
is hard—coded, and will always be present. string will be just the nickname of the

server in the ﬁrst certiﬁcate, and will contain “ <identity>” in the second, self—signed
certiﬁcate.

— Subject Public Key Info:

* Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption
- RSA Public Key:
- Modulus (1024-bit): some number Varies.
- Exponent: 65537(0x10001) This is hard coded into Tor.

Signature Algorithm: shalWithRSAEncryption This is followed by 1024 bits
of signature.
