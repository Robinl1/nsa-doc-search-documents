QUANTUMNATION

QUANTUMNATEON uses new TAU CNE tradecraft and automation to drive broad
scale initial access, specificallv an 556 cloud-analvtic to identify selectors in 550
passive collection that are viable for end-point access, and the use of lightweight
CNE implants to obtain initial access and surveyr data delivered to the TDPI offices
via corporate SIGINT repositories. For More Information on QUANTUMNATION check
the QUANTUMNATIUN wiki page

Target Profiler now shows if a selector is vuinerable to a QUANTUM exploit. If your
target is valid for QUANTUMNATION, A "‘v'ulnerable" link in Target Profiler will
appear. Simply click the link that sends an email to request QUANTUMNATION
tasking.
