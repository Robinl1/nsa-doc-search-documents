WGb Browsing (Exploit with QUANTUM

- The concept man-on—the—side)
*- QUANTUM is a man-onsthe-side capability. If your target has a selector

that is actiye in the last 14 days, yulneralole to the QUANTUM technique,
and seen by an 550 site that has QUANTUM capabilities. then there might
be the opportunity to detect that communication in real-time and piggy
back with the requested content back into the target’s network and
implant the host.

- QUANTUMTHEDRY can he used only if a TAD Project is set up [must
coordinate with your R&T Analyst]

- QUANTUMNATIDN can he used regardless of a TAG Project [TOPI does the
tasking in Target Profiler}

* The biggest difference is QUANTUMTH EORY deploys a stagel implant
called VALIDATDR (soon to be COMMONDEERl and ICIiUANTUMNATla'CJN
deploys a stageU implant called SEASUNEDMDTH (SMOTH). SMOTHs die
within 30 days of deployment unless requested to extend the life. The
exploit technique is the same.
