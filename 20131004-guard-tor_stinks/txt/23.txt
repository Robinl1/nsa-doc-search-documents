Tor Stinks... But it Could be Worse

(S/ISI)

° Critical mass of targets use Tor. Scaring them
away from Tor might be counterproductive.

° We can increase our success rate and provide
more client lPs for individual Tor users.

° Will never get 100% but we don’ t need to

 

provide true IPs for every target every time
they use Tor.
