Analytics: Cookie Leakage

Use cookies to identify Tor users when they are
not using Tor

° Current: preliminary analysis shows that some cookies

“survive" Tor use. Depends on how target is using Tor
(Torbutton/Tor Browser Bundle clears out cookies).

° Goal: test with cookies associated with CT targets

— Idea: what if we seeded cookies to a target?

 

— Investigate Evercookie persistence
