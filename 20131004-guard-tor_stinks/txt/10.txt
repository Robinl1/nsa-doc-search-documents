Analytics: Node Lifespan

How do I know WHEN a particular IP was a Tor
node as opposed to IF it was a Tor node?

° Current: detection done once an hour by NTOC.
RONIN stores “last seen" and nodes age off
slowly with no accurate lifespan.

° Goal: Working with RONIN to add more details
on node lifespan.
