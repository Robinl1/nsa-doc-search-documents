Exploitation: Shaping

Given CNE access to a target computer can we
shape their traffic to “friendly" exit nodes?

Route users to a separate “private" Tor network?
Stain their traffic or user agent?

Instruct target computer to use a service that
connects outside Tor and reveal true IP?

Current: Can stain user agent working on shaping.
