QUANTUM Shooter SBZ Notes - WikiInfo

KEYHOLE/IORCONIPROPIN/RELIDQ/REL TO USA, FVEY *

Once a box has been identiﬁed for use as a QUANTUM shooter, an SBZ is
conﬁgured using FELONYCROWBAR along with a Deployed Node Document
(DND), an XML conﬁg ﬁle. The FELONYCROWBAR GUI and build scripts
handle some aspects of conﬁguration, such as which SBZ modules to include,
but it also needs the DND to conﬁgure most aspects of the communications
links. For an upgrade, an old DND can be modiﬁed by hand, but for a new
build, a new DND will need to be generated in the NCC (with some changes by
hand). Once the core and "bin" customization SBZ ﬁles are generated (usually
a zip ﬁle output from FELONYCROWBAR), an interactive operator can deploy
these to the shooter box.

(U) Infrastructure Components

FREEFLOW

(TS/ISIHREL) There are four operational FREEFLOW threads (plus one for
PASSAGEHILL testing):

I Thread A, the original FREEFLOW thread (early 2008), associated with
the old ROC/MIT covert infrastructure (FORESTPLACE/FUSSYKEEL).

I Thread B, the QUANTUM thread

I Thread C, FINGERGNOME high—to—low transfer

I Thread D, the new FREEFLOW 2.0 thread, associated with new covert
infrastructure (FROZENEARTH).

The FREEFLOW Conﬂuence page (https://conﬂuence—nf.tao.nsa/display
/ROC/FREEFLOW) has a good overview picture, especially showing the
differences between the old FREEFLOW (1.0, the purplish—gray area) and the
new FREEFLOW (2.0, the yellow area). The QUANTUM thread is 1.0 for now,
but will eventually be upgraded and this whole process will change.

FREEFLOW components important for understanding QUANTUM shooters are
described below as they apply to the shooter build process, and a good
overview of the QUANTUM infrastructure can be found here
