QUANTUM Shooter SBZ Notes - WikiInfo

I Disable the CCFP since it requires the node to ack back through the
HANGARSURPLUS (which doesn't exist in the MHS conﬁguration).

I For good measure, conﬁgure only the receive Security Associations and
UDP link (Low Proxy to SBZ), and none of the send SAs/links.

I Conﬁgure BonjourMod to not send heartbeats.

I Conﬁgure szLogMod to not eXﬁl logs.

I Do not include szXﬁlMod if possible, or set Min Priority To Exﬁl to 16.

I Do not include any of the default modules (SiphonCauseway, ShinyObject,
etc.).

(U) Look into testing using CHIMNEYPOOL Python script (”chim.py"?) to issue
commands.
