QUANTUM Shooter SBZ Notes - WikiInfo

(TS/ISLOC/IREL) CHIMNEYPOOL uses its own version of RFC (CHM RPC) for

communications, which ride on the FRIEZERAMP Network Stack
. CHIMNEYPOOL—

compliant nodes are referred to by their four—byte FREIZERAMP (FRZ)
addresses, which are usually represented in hex.

(TS/ISI//REL) Links are half—duplex comms paths that need to be conﬁgured
for two CHM nodes to be able to talk. These can be encrypted or unencrypted
and are usually spit out correctly by the NCC DND, along with the Security
Associations that allow them to communicate with the NCC (keys are
generated by the NCC). To communicate with TURBINE, the SBZ also needs to
have two additional Security Associations conﬁgured —— one to communicate
with SURPLUSHANGAR and one for HANGARSURPLUS.

MIT) usually conﬁgures the HS/SH side, which generates the keys. You'll need
to conﬁgure SAs to match -keys, which can be done either by modifying
the DND, or post—deployment via commands directly to the SBZ via NCC (see

Dave).

(U) NCC

(TS/ISI//REL) The GENIE Network Conﬁguration Center (NCC) manages
CHIMNEYPOOL comms links for all STRAITBIZARRE implants, via
MIDDLEMAN. Information on the NCC is often out of date (the "new" NCC will
be on the high side and will hopefully be easier to update), so onl use the NCC
to generate a DND if you can't modify an old conﬁg, either from”
or from /targets/zombiearmy to ﬁnd the one the operator put on e OX. ou
also need the NCC to manage the links.
