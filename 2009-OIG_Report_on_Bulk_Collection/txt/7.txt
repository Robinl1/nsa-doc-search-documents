Intelligence Value of the Collection

WAS noted, these two collection programs signiﬁcantly strengthen the
Intelligence Community’s early warning system for the detection of terrorists and discovery of
plots against the homeland. They allow the Intelligence Community to detect phone numbers
and e—mail addresses within the United States contacting targeted phone numbers and e-mail
addresses associated with suspected foreign terrorists abroad and vice—versa; and connections
between entities within the United States tied to a suspected foreign terrorist abroad. NSA needs
access to telephony and e-mail transactional information in bulk so that it can quickly identify
the network of contacts that a targeted number or address is connected to, whenever there is RAS
that the number or address is associated with

WTO maximize the operational utility of the data, the data cannot be collected
prospectively once a lead is developed because important connections could be lost in data that
was sent prior to the identiﬁcation of the RAS phone number or e-mail address. NSA identiﬁes
the network of contacts by applying sophisticated analysis to the massive volume of metadata.
(Communications metadata is the dialing, routing, addressing or signaling information associated
with an electronic communication, but not content). The more metadata NSA has access to, the
more likely it is that NSA can identify or discover the network of contacts linked to targeted
numbers or addresses. Information discovered through NSA’s analysis of the metadata is then
provided to the appropriate federal national security agencies, including the FBI, which are
responsible for further investigation or analysis of any potential terrorist threat to the United
States.

—(‘FS#SI#NEJ- In conclusion, the Section 215 and pen—trap bulk collection programs
provide a Vital capability to the Intelligence Community. The attacks of 9/11 taught us that
applying lead information from foreign intelligence in a comprehensive and systemic fashion is
required to protect the homeland, and the programs discussed in this paper cover a critical scam
in our defense against terrorism. Recognizing that the programs have implications for the
privacy interests of US. person data, extensive policies, safeguards, and reviews have been
enacted by the FISA Court, DOJ, ODNI and NSA.
