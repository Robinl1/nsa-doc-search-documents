Dear Chairman Reyes:

—($S}Thank you for your letter of September 30, 2009, requesting that the Department of
Justice provide a document to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence
(HPSCI) that describes the bulk collection program conducted under Section 215 -- the
“business records” provision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). We
agree that it is important that all Members of Congress have access to information about
this program, as well as a similar bulk collection program conducted under the pen
register/trap and trace authority of FISA, when considering reauthorization of the
expiring USA PATRIOT Act provisions.

{£63 The Department has therefore worked with the Intelligence Community to prepare
the enclosed document that describes these two bulk collection programs, the authorities
under which they operate, the restrictions imposed by the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Court, the National Security Agency’s record of compliance, and the

ortance of these programs to the national security of the United States. W:

M document available to all Members of Congress IS an effective way to
W the egls ative debate about reauthorization of Section 215 and any changes to the

_FISA, pen register/trap and trace authority. However, as you know, it is critical that
Members understand the importance to national security of maintaining the secrecy of

these programs, and that the HPSCI’s plan to make the document available to other
Members is subject to strict rules.
