Key Points

0 WProvisions of the USA PATRIOT Act affected by reauthorization legislation
support two sensitive intelligence collection programs;

0 {Tm-These programs are authorized to collect in bulk certain dialing, routing,
addressing and signaling information about telephone calls and electronic
communications, such as the telephone numbers or e-mail addresses that were
communicating and the times and dates but not the content of the calls or e-mail
messages themselves;

0 WAlthough the programs collect a large amount of information, the vast
majority of that information is never reviewed by anyone in the government, because the
information is not responsive to the limited queries that are authorized for intelligence
purposes;

0 {PM The programs are subject to an extensive regime of internal checks,
particularly for US. persons, and are monitored by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Court (“FISA Court”) and Congress;

WTbe Executive Branch, including DOJ, ODNI, and NSA, takes any

compliance problems in the programs ve seriousl and substantial ro ess has been
made in addressin those roblems.

     
 

0 WSW NSA’s bulk collection programs provide important tools in the ﬁght against
terrorism, especially in identifying terrorist plots against the homeland. These tools are
also unique in that they can produce intelligence not otherwise available to NSA.
