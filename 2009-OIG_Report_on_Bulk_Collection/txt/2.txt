—6¥S;_Therefore, the enclosed document is being provided on the understanding that it
will be provided only to Members of Congress (and cleared HPSCI, Judiciary Committee,
and leadership staff), in a secure location in the HPSCI’s ofﬁces, for a limited time period
to be agreed upon, and consistent with the rules of the HPSCI regarding review of
classiﬁed information and non-disclosure agreements. No photocopies may be made of
the document, and any notes taken by Members may not be removed from the secure
location. We further understand that HPSCI staff will be present at all times when the
document is being reviewed, and that Executive Branch officials will be available nearby
during certain, pre—established times to answer questions should they arise. We also
request your support in ensuring that the Members are well informed regarding the
importance of tln's classiﬁed and extremely sensitive information to prevent any
unauthorized disclosures resulting from this process. We intend to provide the same
document to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) under similar conditions,
so that it may be made available to the Members of the Senate, as well as cleared
leadership, SSCI and Senate Judiciary Committee staff.

(U) Thank you again for your letter, and we look forward to continuing to work with you
and your staff as Congress continues its deliberations on reauthorizing the expiring
provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act.

Sincerely,

Ronald Weich
Assistant Attorney General
