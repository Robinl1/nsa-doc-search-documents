profile/signature so can spot attacks leaving a box. Need

Experiment Capability Cap.16 Remote hashinq of files

Experiment Convergence Conv.01 Data must be of a format which enables it to be merged with STARGATE ROADMAP iteration 7-10 (corporate framework,
data from other sources Itools in any future converged native viewing, CMS, convergence)
platform. E.g. putting internet selector (I'Dl) related material
into passive events systems and auto-correlating activity
from a CNE implant to the same intercept collected in
passive

Experiment Convergence Conv.02 Metadata must be exportable to other relevant tools. STARGATE (Graphical query engine)
