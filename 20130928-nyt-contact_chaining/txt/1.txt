(SEISIHREU Analysts and Mission Managers: ﬂu 29 November, SIGI'NT
- signed SID Management Directive iSMDl $124, which changes
procedures regarding metadata analysis. Speciﬁcally, these new procedures
permit contact chaining, and other analysis, from told through
my selector, irrewectiue of nationality or location, in ortler to
ﬁllow or discover valid foreign intelligence targets. [Formerly
analysts were required to determine whether or not selectors were associated
with US communicants.)

(U) The hupact

(SJJSIHREU These new procedures allow NSA to fully exploit
communications metadata (which is stric’dy defined in the procedures), for
foreign intelligence purposes, widiont the restrictions associated with selection
of communications content. The impact of the new procedures is two—fold. In
the ﬁrst place it allows NSA to discover and track connections between foreign
intelligence targets and possible 2nd Party or US communicants. [n the second
place it enables large—scale graph analysis on very large sets of
communications metadata without having to check foreignness of every node
or address in the graph. Analysts in 52 have used this to great beneﬁt over the
past year and a half under a pilot program.
