A&P Staff‘s Access Interface Portfolio (S203A)

(C) From time to time. SID is offered access to the personal contact databases of US ofﬁcials. Such "rolo-
dexes" may contain contact information for foreign political or military leaders, to include direct line. fax, resi-
dence and cellular numbers.

(C) In one recent case, a US official provided NSA with 200 phone numbers to 35 world leaders. 82 Opera-
tions Staff immediately supplied this information to the 32 Production Centers (PCs). Despite the fact that
the majority is probably available via open source. the PCs have noted 43 previously unknown phone num-
bers. These numbers plus several others have been tasked to OCTAVE.

(C) Thus far, the PCs have noted little reportable intelligence from these particular numbers, which appear
not to be used for sensitive discussions. However, these numbers have provided lead information to other
numbers that have subsequently been tasked.

(C) This success leads 82 to wonder if there are NSA liaisons whose supported customers may be willing to
share their rotodexes or phone lists with NSA as potential sources of intelligence. 82 welcomes such infor-
mation! Anyone who can help us obtain such phone lists should contact the 8203 Operations Staff Access
