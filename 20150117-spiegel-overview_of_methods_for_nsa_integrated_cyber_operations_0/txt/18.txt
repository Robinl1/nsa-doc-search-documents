- Man—on-the—Side technique

- Briefly hi—jacl<s connections to a terrorist
website

- Re-directs the target to a TAO server (FOXACID)
for implantation

- Takes control of idle IRC bots
- Finds computers belonging to botnets, and
hijacks the command and control channel

- Enhances QUANTUMINSERT's man-on-the—side
technique of exploitation

- Motivated by the need to Ql targets that are
behind large proxies, |ac|< predictable source
addresses, and have insufficient unique web
activity.

- DNS injection/redirection based off ofA Record
queries.
- Targets single hosts or caching name servers.

Highly Successful
(In 2010, 300 TAO implants
were deployed via
QUANTUMINSERT to targets that
were un-exploitable by any
other means)

Highly Successful

(over 140,000 bots co-opted)

Limited success at
NSAW due to high

latency on passive

access
(GCHQ uses technique for 80%
of CNE accesses)

Successful

(High priority CCI target
