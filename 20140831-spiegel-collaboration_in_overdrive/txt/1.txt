that collaboration really is efﬁcient!
SIG DEV analysts and target ofﬁce
elements (TOPI) within International
Security Issues (181), with lots of help
from their friends in SIGINT Strategy
and Governance (886) and the Tailored

ended up with a winning combination.
The 151 SIGDEV/TOPI effort focused
development by identifying a 90-day
surge team comprising SIGDEV, TOPI,
SSG analysts (templating) and TAO.
The team then employed target
