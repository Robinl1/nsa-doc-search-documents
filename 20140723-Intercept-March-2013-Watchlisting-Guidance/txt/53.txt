this speciﬁc vulnerability and counters the ability of KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS to
target US. Government facilities outside of the “homeland” (e. g., the October 12, 2000 attack
upon the US. Navy guided missile destroyer USS Cole while it was harbored in the Yemeni
port of Aden).

Fourth No Fly List Criterion.

4.8.1 Enable Flexibility. The fourth No Fly List criterion (see Paragraph 4.5.4) is intended to

enable flexibility for nominations to the No Fly List of OPERATIONALLY CAPABLE
KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS who pose a threat of committing an act of
international TERRORISM abroad, but who do not meet the first, second or third No Fly
List criterion because they do not pose a threat to civil aviation, a threat to the homeland,
or a threat to US. facilities and their associated or supporting personnel. Previously, the
No Fly List criteria did not prevent KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS from traveling
aboard aircraft, even though they may have had the intent and OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY
to commit a TERRORIST act against US. nationals abroad (outside of the “homeland”) or
against a target with no nexus to the United States or its nationals. The fourth No Fly
List criterion now addresses these two vulnerabilities.

4.8.2 OPERATIONALLY CAPABLE Deﬁned. An individual is “OPERATIONALLY CAPABLE” if,

based on credible intelligence, he or she, acting individually or in concert with others,
reasonably appears to have the ability, knowledge, opportunity, and intent or is actively
seeking the opportunity to engage in a violent act of TERRORISM consistent with 18
U.S.C. 2331 or 18 U.S.C. 2332b. For example, attempting to obtain an lED would
indicate an individual is OPERATIONALLY CAPABLE of committing an act of TERRORISM.
However, simply conducting internet research concerning lEDs would not be sufficient
without additional activity. Depending on the circumstances, and in combination with
other facts, scouting potential targets or traveling for no legitimate purpose to places that
have TERRORIST training grounds, regardless of whether the person is presently capable
of using an lED, might also indicate an individual is OPERATIONALLY CAPABLE of
committing an act of TERRORISM.

 

4.8.3 Possible Indicators of Being OPERATIONALLY CAPABLE. ln determining whether an

individual is OPERATIONALLY CAPABLE, consideration should be given to the following
indicators regarding ability, knowledge, opportunity, and/or intent:

4.8.3.1 Subject has undergone TERRORIST training or been provided some instruction,
to include receiving military training by a designated terrorist group;

4.8.3.2 Subject has indicated intent to participate in planning/conducting an attack;

4.8.3.3 Subject has expressed desire to martyr him/herself;

4.8.3.4 Subject is in repeated contact with a KNOWN TERRORIST facilitator who
recruits or facilitates travel of operatives;

4.8.3.5 Subject is planning an attack either alone or as part ofa group; or,
