UNCLASSIFIED/lFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION

enforcement communities have the most current and thorough TERRORISM INFORMATION
available about a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST. Most—but not all—of that
TERRORISM INFORMATION is available in a structured format as part of the KNOWN or
SUSPECTED TERRORIST record (e. g., discrete elements such as a date of birth, country of
origin). The unstructured TERRORISM INFORMATION, while also in digitized format (e. g.,
a computer disk, a scanned image of a business card, an encountering ofﬁcer’s report), is
handled by NCTC.

5.15 NCTC Actions. NCTC will post to TIDE Online any digitized ENCOUNTER PACKAGE it
receives from ’l‘SC or directly from a SCREENER. ENCOUNTER PACKAGES can be found under
the subject’s main page.

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR UPDATING EXISTING KNOWN
OR SUSPECTED TERRORIST RECORDS AND NOMINATING NEW
KNOWN OR SUSPECTED TERRORISTS BASED ON INFORMATION
FROM POSITIVE ENCOUNTERS

5.16 This section describes the roles and responsibilities of thc watchlisting, screening, and
counterterrorism communities for exploitation and analysis of the TERRORISM INFORMA'I‘ION
lawfully collected and shared when there is a POSITIVE MATCH to a KNOWN or SUSPECTED
TERRORIST. In this context the following deﬁnitions apply:

5.16.1 “INITIAL REVIEW” means a quick review of the ENCOUNTER PACKAGE to identify
obvious, new TERRORIST lDENTlFlERS about the KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST.

5.16.2 “ADVANCED ANALYSIS” means a thorough review of the TERRORISM lNl-‘ORMATION
contained in an ENCOUNTER PACKAGE obtained as a result of the ENCOUNTER with the
KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST. ADVANCED ANALYSIS includes the adding of
TERRORIST IDENTIFIERS to existing KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST records and
identifying new KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS who should be nominated through
the existing nomination process. In this context, ADVANCED ANALYSIS is being done on
a tactical matter related to the speciﬁc KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST to identify
information useful in “connecting the dots” between and among that KNOWN or
SUSPECTED TERRORIST and other KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS or potential KNOWN
or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. It is also when the need for foreign language translation
services will be identiﬁed.

5.16.3 “TARGETED ANALYSIS” means further exploitation of a targeted set of ENCOUNTER
PACKAGES and ADVANCED ANALYSIS products to assist in identifying TERRORIST trends
and changes to methods, tactics, and practices. ENCOUNTERS for TARGETED ANALYSIS
are selected using contemporaneous threat criteria and research in additional
repositories. Contemporaneous threat criteria includes association with a priority
terrorist group (e.g., NIPF Tier I or II); ENCOUNTERS with KNOWN or SUSPECTED
