Addendum B to the TSC MOU“ requires that any recipient of information from the TSDB
seeking to use TERRORIST identity information in any legal or administrative process or
proceeding obtain NOMINATOR approval before doing so. Approval from the entity which
provided the information, if other than the NOMINATOR, is also required. Additionally,
information from Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) collections may only be used
in a proceeding with the advance authorization of the Attorney General. Therefore, any
SCREENER seeking to use TSDB information in any process or proceeding must contact TSC
so that TSC can assist in obtaining approval from the NOMINATOR, owner of the information,
or Attorney General, as required.

1.23 In addition to the foregoing restrictions, there are restrictions on sharing information with
foreign governments. Any TERRORIST IDENTIFIER (as described in Addendum B to the TSC
MOU) will be deemed U//FOUO and shared with the watchlisting community and foreign
governments for watchlisting purposes pursuant to the terms of the TSC MOU. Accordingly,
NOMINA'I‘ORS should include, as appropriate, 'l‘liRRORIST IDENTII’IERS in documents that contain
non-releasable warnings (e. g., a report is not releasable to xxx/yyy/zzz countries), unless the
TERRORIST IDENTIFIERS are restricted by some other authority that limits dissemination. 1f U.S.
PERSON information is otherwise authorized for release to the foreign government, the non-
releasable warning is disabled to allow dissemination of the information.

V. WATCHLISTING STANDARD: IDENTIFYING AND SUBSTANTIVE
DEROGATORY CRITERIA

1.24 Before a KNOWN or SUSPECTED 'I‘ERRORIS’I‘ is added to the Terrorist Watchlist, TSC reviews
the nomination to determine whether it meets the following minimum identifying criteria and
minimum substantive derogatory criteria for inclusion in the TSDB.

1.24.1 Minimum Identifying Criteria. Each nomination must contain minimum
identifying criteria for inclusion into the TSDB. Without this minimum identifying data,
the nomination is not eligible for inclusion into the TSDB, or any of the TSC’s
supported systems. Chapter 2 sets forth guidance regarding both the minimum
identifying biometric and biographic criteria for inclusion into the TSDB. Although
TIDE accepts records containing less than these minimum criteria, such records will not
be exported either to the TSDB for watchlisting or to the various supported systems used
by the SCREENERS absent an exception described in the Watchlisting Guidance.

1.24.2 Minimum Substantive Derogatory Criteria. In addition to the minimum
identifying criteria, nominations to the TSDB are accepted based on a REASONABLE
SUSPICION that the individual is a KNOWN or SUSPECI‘ED TERRORIST derived from the
