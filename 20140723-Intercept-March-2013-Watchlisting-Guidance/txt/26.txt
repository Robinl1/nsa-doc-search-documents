l.56.2.l.7 Tipoff Australia Counterterrorism Information Control System
(TACTICS).

l.56.2.2 Reject Nomination. lfa nomination lacks either the minimum substantive
derogatory criteria or the minimum identifying information, and is not an
exception to those requirements (e. g., TIDE Category Codes 50 or 99 as described
in Paragraph l.53.2), TSC will reject the nomination and notify NCTC directly of
its determination or coordinate with NCTC to notify the NOMINATOR of its
determination. Records nominated to TIDE that are ineligible for 'I‘ERRORIST
watchlisting may remain in TIDE until additional information is obtained to
warrant either watchlisting or removal from TIDE. NCTC analysts will review all-
source information for additional identifying or substantive DEROGATORY
INFORMATION. If additional information is discovered, NCTC will enhance the
TIDE record and submit the record to TSC for inclusion in the TSDB. The TIDE
record will be reviewed again by the TSC to determine whether it is eligible for
watchlisting in TSDB and export to certain supported screening systems.33

l.57 The number of TSC’s supported systems will continue to grow as TSC, DHS, and DOS
expand their domestic and international outreach efforts and ﬁnalize additional agreements to
exchange TERRORISM SCREENING INFORMATION. TSC has modiﬁed the 1808 so that certain
customers may query the TSDB remotely instead of receiving exports of TSDB data to their
own systems.

[.58 Expedited Nomination Procedures for Individual Nominations. ll'exigent
circumstances exist (imminent travel and/or threat) where an individual nomination into the
TSDB needs to be expedited after normal duty hours, a NOMINATOR, with coordination from
NCTC, may contact the TSC’s TSOC directly. If a NOMINATOR coordinated with NCTC, the
nomination will be received by the TSC via the SRQ in TSDB and the TSOC Watch
Commander will coordinate with a NDIU Senior Analyst to process the nomination. A
NOMINATOR may also contact the TSC directly and provide all relevant information using the
following process:

l.58.l The NOMINA't‘OR must ﬁrst contact the TSOC at 866—_ (toll free number) or

at 57 | -_

I582 The NOMINATOR will be instructed by a TSOC Specialist on how to telephonically
complete a Terrorist Screening Center Expedited Nomination Request Form.

l.58.3 In addition to basic identifying information, the NOMINATOR will be requested to
provide a 24/7 point of contact should the KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST be
encountered by a SCREENER.
