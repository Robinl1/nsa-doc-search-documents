leader Usama bin Laden on May 2, 201 1.54 Likewise, individuals listed on a roster of an
IED cell could be nominated solely on the presence of their name on the list. An
identity from a captured passport, however, would only be watchlisted if additional
reporting documents REASONABLE SUSPICION to believe that the individual is connected
to TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITY.

“LONE WOLF” TERRORISTS should be nominated when PARTICULARIZED DEROUATORY
INFORMATION and their actions support a REASONABLE SUSPICION that they are engaged
in, or have engaged in, TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. No present known
affiliation with a terror group, organization, or cell is required but prior afﬁliations, if

V. EXCEPTIONS TO SUPPORT IMMIGRATION AND VISA SCREENING
ACTIVITIES BY DIIS AND DOS

3.14 TSDB Minimum Substantive Derogatory Exceptions to Support Immigration and Visa
Screening Activities by the DHS and DOS. The Watchlisting Guidance contains certain
exceptions to the minimum substantive derogatory criteria for 'I‘ERRORIST watchlisting that
support immigration and visa screening activities by the D1 IS and DOS to determine whether
grounds exist to deny admission of aliens to the United States (including denials ofvisas) or to
deny other immigration beneﬁts pursuant to the INA.55 PARTICULARIZED DEROGATORY
INFORMATION is not required for nominations made pursuant to the following sections.
Because the INA delines “aliens” as “any person not a citizen or national ofthe United
States”56, the INA admissibility provisions also apply to LPRs, in certain circumstances
including those described in INA section 101(a)(13)(C)[8 U.S.C. 1 lOl(a)(l3)(C)], who are
considered as U.S. PERSONS under Executive Order 12333. Consequently, NCTC developed a
mechanism in TIDE to identify and distinguish U.S. citizens from non-U.S. citizens in order
to further distinguish between “aliens” under the INA and U.S. PERSONS under Executive
Order 12333. The following subsections are exceptions to the REASONABLE SUSPICION
standard and will only be transmitted to DOS’s CLASS (via the DOS CCD) and DI lS’s WLS
to support immigration and visa screening processes.

watchl isted.

55 INA section 212(a)(3)(B)[8 U.S.C. 1 182(a)(3)(B)] sets forth several grounds for inadmissibility based on terrorist
activities, which is defined in INA section 212(a)(3)(B)(iii)[8 U.S.C. 1 182(a)(3)(B)(Iii)]. For example, INA section
212(a)(3)(B)(i)(V11) states that any alien who “endorses or espouses terrorist activity or persuades others to endorse or
espouse terrorist activity or support a terrorist organization” is inadmissible to the United States. 8 U.S.C.

speciﬁcally reference the INA follow the deﬁnition outlined in Chapter 1 and Appendix 1.
