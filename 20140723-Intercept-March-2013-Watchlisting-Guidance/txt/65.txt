UNCLASSIFIElI//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION

TERRORISM INFORMATION on the ENCOUNTER Information List gathered during the
ENCOUNTER. Provision of any material collected by the foreign partner depends on the
arrangement with, and legal authorities of, the particular foreign partner involved. Therefore,
gathering and sharing this TERRORISM INFORMATION will be done on a case—by-case, country—
by—country basis.

5.8 Federal Bureau of Investigation/Law Enforcement ENCOUNTERS. These ENCOUNTERS can
be subdivided into three categories:

5.8.l Name-Based Queries. Name-based transaction queries by law enforcement personnel
(e.g., trafﬁc stops) made to the FBI’s National Crime Information Center at the Criminal
Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division that match a name in the KSTF (a sub-ﬁle
of NCIC) are deemed to be POTENTIAL MATCHES. They are routed electronically to TSC
for conﬁrmation and subsequent processing as an ENCOUNTER.

5.8.2 Fingerprint-Based Queries. Fingerprint-based queries submitted for criminal
identiﬁcation purposes (e. g., an arrest/booking) or for civil identiﬁcation purposes (e. g.,
an employment background check) are made to the Integrated Automatic Fingerprint
Identiﬁcation System (IAFIS). For POSI'I'IVE MATCHES to records ﬂagged as KNOWN or
SUSPECTED TERRORIS’I‘ records, the CJIS Division’s Special Identities Unit notiﬁes the
TSC and the FBI case agent (or the Agency that identiﬁed the subject as a possible
TERRORIST). In similar fashion, CJIS Division’s Global Initiatives Unit coordinates
positive ﬁngerprint hits from its foreign submissions with the Legal Attaché. It should
be noted that lAFIS and NCIC are separate systems that are not fully synchronized at the
present time.

5.8.3 National Instant Criminal Background Check System. All background checks
resulting from attempts to buy ﬁrearms or to obtain explosive permits submitted to the
National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NlCS) at C] IS are run against the
KS'I‘I". 'l‘he TSC is immediately notiﬁed of all KSTF “hits.” NICS consults with TSC
to conﬁrm the POSITIVE MATCHES and the FBI case agent to determine whether there is
available information about the prospective purchaser to disqualify him or her from
possessing a ﬁrearm or explosive as a matter of law. Regardless of whether the
purchase is denied or permitted to proceed, all available information is obtained and
provided to the TSC and, in turn, CTD, as TERRORISM INFORMATION and processed as an
ENCOUNTER.

5.9 Department of Defense ENCOUNTERS. The Department of Defense (DOD) has force
protection, operational capture/apprehend, and intelligence responsibilities and on occasion
encounters KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. To the extent DOD knowingly encounters a
KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST, 000 will report the ENCOUNTER in intelligence channels or
to the FBI in cases described in the MOU between the FBI and DoD Governing Information
Sharing, Operational Coordination and Investigative Responsibilities signed August 2, 20l l
where the FBI is the lead. In cases where the FBI is not the lead for the ENCOUNTER, the
