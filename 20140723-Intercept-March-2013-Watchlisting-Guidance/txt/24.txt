TERRORIST but are not alien spouses or children ofa TERRORIST. For instance, the
father or brother ofa TERRORIST could have a record in TIDE (also known as TIDE
Category Code 160). Thus, these “other relatives” could be U.S. PERSONS or non-
U.S. PERSONS. Identifiers for these other relations reside in TIDE but are not
exported to the TSC for watchlisting, absent independent DEROGATORY
INFORMATION. Instead, these records may be retained in TIDE for analytic
purposes;

1.53.2.3 Passports. Unrecovered lost or stolen passports in the hands of international
TERRORISTS (also known as TIDE Category Code 89);

1.53.2.4 Associates. Individuals who have a deﬁned relationship with the KNOWN or
SUSPECTED TERRORIST, but whose involvement with the KNOWN or SUSPECTED
'l‘ERRORIST’S activities is unknown (also known as TIDE Category Code 50);

1.53.2.5 Individuals with a Possible Nexus to TERRORISM. Individuals with a
possible nexus to TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITY but for whom additional
DEROGATORY INFORMATION is needed to meet the REASONABLE SUSPIClON standard
(also known as ’I‘IDE Category Code 99).

1.54 Identification of U.S. PERSON Status in TIDE. NCTC analysts will review the totality of
information available on a subject to discern U.S. PERSON status prior to creating or
enhancing a record in TIDE, whenever possible. For existing TIDE records, this status is
available to the analyst in the first field of the TIDE record. In case of external
nominations or ENIIANCEMENTS from the 1C, the standard nomination template provides a
means for NOMINATORS to identify U.S. PERSON status pursuant to Executive Order 12333
and the Agency’s speciﬁc guidelines. The U.S. PERSON status ﬁeld on the standard
nomination template is a required ﬁeld and it is the responsibility of each NOMINATING
AGENCY to ensure the field is properly annotated in accordance with established policy.

1.55 Types of Records in TIDE and the TSDB. Not all records in TIDE are included in the
TSDB. For example, records with FRAGMENTARY INFORMATION that do not meet the
minimum derogatory standard or records that do not meet identifying information criteria
remain in TIDE and are not included in the TSDB, absent direction for temporary, threat
based categories pursuant to Paragraph 1 .59.” The nominations process for TIDE records
that will be considered for entry in the TSDB begins with an automated data transfer process
that moves an individual TIDE record containing the identity ofa KNOWN or SUSPECTED
TERRORIST or other exportable category or record nominated for watchlisting to the TSDB.

1.56 TSC Actions and Processes. The TSC’s Single Review Queue (SRQ) enables the TSC’s
Nominations and Data Integrity Unit (NDIU) to review each KNOWN or SUSPECTIED TERRORIS‘I'

 

3° Certain categories of non-TERRORIST records (see Paragraph 1.53.2) or nominations to the No Fly and Selectee List
based on an expedited waiver of “full date of birth” requirement (see Paragraph 4.18) may also be eligible for inclusion
in the TSDB.
