commercial flight manifests, as well as, commercial vessel manifest for travel to and
from the United States. With the exception of passenger information required by law to
be transmitted to DHS prior to a passenger’s arrival, most information is generally
collected by CBP when the person is interviewed or apprehended. The National
’l‘argeting Center — Passenger (NTC-P) and NTC-Cargo (NTC-C) are CBP entities
responsible for communicating with the TSC regarding ENCOUNTERS with KNOWN or
SUSPECTED TERRORIS'I‘S, to include providing relevant ENCOUNTER information.84 NTC-
P and NTC-C also provide a copy of the examination results to the TSOU for
dissemination to the appropriate investigating Agencies.

5.4.2 Transportation Security Administration. TSA generally encounters KNOWN or
SUSPECTED TERRORISTS through screening commercial aircraft passengers against
subsets of the TSI)B and during the application process for a credential or beneﬁt in the
transportation or critical infrastructure environment (e. g., Transportation Worker
Identiﬁcation Credential (TWIC)). When an airline encounters subjects who are
possible matches to the No Fly or Selectee List, the air carriers are required to supply the
passenger’s name and one piece of identifying data (in the form of a government-issued
photo identiﬁcation that contains a date of birth) to the TSA’s Ofﬁce of Intelligence and
Analysis (OIA). TSA OIA submits that information, along with information regarding
the carrier, ﬂight number, time of departure, and destination to the TSC.

5.4.2.l Absent an arrest warrant, or unless probable cause arises during the
ENCOUNTER, SCREENERS are reminded that placement on the No Fly or Selectee
List is not a legal basis to detain a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST. To the
extent legal authority exists to question a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST,
encounters with No Fly subjects at the airport may provide an additional
opportunity to lawfully obtain ENCOUNTER PACKAGE information. For No Fly
subjects who have made a domestic reservation, DHS will notify TSC in advance
as well as when the No Fly subject presents at the airport ticket counter. TSC will
then notify the TSOU who will notify both the FBI case agent and the airport
liaison agent to coordinate the appropriate operational response.

5.4.2.2 For KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST ENCOUNTERS as a result of an
individual applying for a TSA beneﬁt or credential, ENCOUNTER PACKAGE
information can include any supporting documents or information collected as a
part of the application process. The ENCOUNTER, and any corresponding
information, is communicated to the TSC and other Government Agencies, as
appropriate through TSA OIA.

5.4.3 United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. US. Citizenship and
Immigration Services (USCIS) interact with millions ofindividuals every year and

 

3‘ CBP may also encounter such individuals in the course of processing an application and/or conducting an interview
of an applicant for a trusted traveler program (e.g., NEXUS, Free and Secure Trade (FAST), Global Entry, SENTRI,
etc.).
