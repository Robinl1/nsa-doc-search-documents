nature of the threat involved, not to exceed 30 days but may be renewed for additional
30-day periods upon written approval ofthe Deputies or Principals Committee. A 'l‘BU
is valid until the threat no longer exists. To the extent that such threat recedes or is
otherwise mitigated prior to the expiration of 30 days or during any extension approved
by the Deputies or Principals Committee, TSC and NCTC and members of the
watchlisting community shall immediately request of the Deputies or Principals
Committee to downgrade these TBUs to their original or appropriate status. All threat-
based records transmitted through automated mechanisms (i.e., WLS, CCD) will include
a “TBU indicator” at the message level to differentiate this category of records from
non-TBU records and to provide the TBU directive for which the record is upgraded.

1.59.4 Until such time as the Deputies or Principals provide additional, written guidance,
DOS will defer visa actions with respect to these expedited upgrades in watchlist status.

1.59.5 Departments and Agencies will advise the Deputies or Principals of other
consequences that may result from a change in watchlist status and seek guidance as to
how to proceed.

1.59.6 After these categorical moves are accomplished or renewed, there will be an
expedited procedure for the review of all U. S. PERSONS that are part ofthe TBU to ensure
their watchlisting status is appr0priate (including whether continued categorical
watchlisting may be warranted based on the nature of the threat).
