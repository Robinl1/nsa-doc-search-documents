CHAPTER 3: MINIMUM SUBSTANTIVE DEROGATORY CRITERIA

INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE

TSC issued an updated US. Government Protocol Regarding Terrorist Nominations on
February 25, 2009, that included an appendix identifying the minimum substantive derogatory
criteria for acceptance of KNOWN or SUSPECTED 'l‘liRRORIST nominations into the 'l‘SDB.

Based on the attempted terror attack of December 25, 2009, the Watchlisting Guidance was
reviewed to determine whether adjustments were needed. The revised guidance was approved
by the White House Deputies Committee on May 25, 2010 and issued to the watchlisting
community on July 16, 2010, after a multi-agency classiﬁcation review.

This Chapter of the Watchlisting Guidance has been updated to reﬂect the watchlisting
community’s experiences with the Guidance since issuance in July of 201 0 by the Deputies
Committee. One of the more notable changes ofthis updated version of the Watchlisting
Guidance is the restructuring of instances for when PARTICULARIZED DEROGATORY
INFORMATION is required. Another notable change includes the re-introduction of guidance
relative to the TERRORIST facilitators or supporters from an earlier version of the Watchlisting
Guidance and the inclusion of additional exceptions to the minimum substantive derogatory

standards for TERRORIST watchlisting that support immigration and visa screening activities of
the DOS and DHS.

REASONABLE SUSPICION

For purposes of watchlisting an individual to the TSDB, the NOMINA'I‘OR should determine
whether there is REASONABLE SUSPICION that an individual is a KNOWN or SUSPECTED
TERRORIST.40

REASONABLE SUSPICION. To meet the REASONABLE SUSPICION standard, the NOMINA’I‘OR,
based on the totality ofthe circumstances, must rely upon articulable intelligence or
information which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably
warrants a determination that an individual is known or suspected to be or has been knowingly
engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to TERRORISM and/or
TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. There must be an objective factual basis for the NOMINATOR to believe
that the individual is a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST. Mere guesses or hunches are not
sufﬁcient to constitute a REASONABLE SUSPICION that an individual is a KNOWN or SUSPECTED
TERRORIST. Reporting of suspicious activity alone that does not meet the REASONABLE
SUSPICION standard set forth herein is not a sufficient basis to watchlist an individual. The
facts, however, given fair consideration, should sensibly lead to the conclusion that an
individual is, or has, engaged in TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.

 

4° ln instances where REASONABLE SUSPICION is not found, NOMINATORS should also determine whether the individual
should be nominated to support immigration and visa screening by DHS and DOS (see Chapter 3, Section V).
