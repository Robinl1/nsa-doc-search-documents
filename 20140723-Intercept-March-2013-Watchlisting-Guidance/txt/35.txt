Due Weight. In determining whether a REASONABLE SUSPICION exists, due weight should be
given to the specific reasonable inferences that a NOMINATOR is entitled to draw from the facts
in light of his/her experience and not on unfounded suspicions or hunches. Although
irrefutable evidence or concrete facts are not neccssary, to be reasonable, suspicion should be
as clear and as fully developed as circumstances permit. For additional guidance regarding
the nomination of U.S. PERSONS, see Paragraph 3. l 5.

NOMINATORS shall not nominate an individual based on source reporting that NOMINATING
personnel identify as, or know to be, unreliable or not credible. Single source information,
including but not limited to “walk-in”, “write-in”, or postings on social media sites, however,
should not automatically be discounted merely because of the manner in which it was
received. Instead, the NOMINATING AGENCY should evaluate the credibility of the source, as
well as the nature and speciﬁcity of the information, and nominate even ifthat source is
uncorroborated, assuming the information supports a REASONABLE SUSPICION that the
individual is a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST or there is another basis for watchlisting the
individual.

Criteria and Data Quality. To demonstrate that the nomination has sufﬁcient indicia of
reliability to support a REASONABLE SUSPICION determination, NOMINA'I‘ING AGENCIES should
incorporate processes designed to ensure that nominations are free of errors, and to the extent
possible given the nature of the reporting, have not come from sources known or determined
to be unreliable. NOMINATING AGENCIES should, to the extent possible, verify the accuracy
and reliability of the information included in nominations. In addition to ensuring that
nominations are free from errors, NOMINATING AGENCIES should implement procedures
designed to ensure that recalled or revised information is reviewed regularly, and that
necessary corrections to nominations based on those revisions/retractions are made.

PARTICULARIZED DEROGATORY INFORMATION. PARTICULARIZED DEROGATORY
INFORMATION is the type of information relied on to determine whether REASONABLE
SUSPICION is met. This is information that demonstrates the nature of an individual’s or
group’s association with TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES that is descriptive and
specific to an event or activity, and is more than a label. For example, “Subject X provides
false travel documentation for Al-Qaida operatives” is PARTICULARIZED DEROGATORY
INFORMATION, whereas “Subject Y is a supporter,” standing alone, is not considered

PAR l‘lCULARlZED DEROGATORY INFORMATION.

Potential Behavioral Indicators. In making a REASONABLE SUSPICION determination,
NOMINATORS should consider behavioral indicators known to be associated with particular
KNOWN or SUSPECTED 'I‘ERRORISTS. The following is a list ol‘a few examples of those
indicators. It is not an exclusive list and it includes activity that may have innocent
explanations wholly unrelated to TERRORISM. Furthermore, some activities conducted by U.S.
PERSONS or activities taking place within the United States, may be an exercise of rights
guaranteed by the First Amendment. Watchlisting an individual for engaging solely in
