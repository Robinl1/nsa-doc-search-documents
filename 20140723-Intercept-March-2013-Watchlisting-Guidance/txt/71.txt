5.14

INFORMATION during law enforcement ENCOUNTERS (e.g., trafﬁc violations, investigations,
arrests) are coordinated between the NOMINATING AGENCY and the ENCOUNTERING AGENCY via
TSOU.

5.13.] For domestic and international ENCOUNTERS with a person who is a POSITIVE MATCH
to a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST, TSOU will do the following: After receiving
notiﬁcation of an ENCOUNTER from the TSC, TSOU will disseminate and coordinate
information to FBI operational entities and federal, state, and local law enforcement
Agencies. TSOU simultaneously coordinates with the appropriate FBI Field Division(s)
and Case Agent(s); Joint Terrorist Task Forces (JTTFs); Airport Liaison Agents and
Attaches (ALAS); ;Legal Attachés (LEGATs); U.S. Embassies and/or other appropriate
law enforcement ofﬁcials, including ICE and CBP (speciﬁcally, NTC-P and NTC-C as
appropriate); and appropriate members of the IC. For outbound ENCOUNTERS, or
ENCOUN'I‘ERS involving subjects who have certain DEROGA'fORY INFORMATION, TSOU
contacts (via phone and electronic notification) the appropriate counterterrorism
element(s). Especially sensitive ENCOUNTERS often require coordination and situational
updates with the White House, Northern Command (NORTIICOM), and FBI’S
Counterterrorism-Watch.

TSC Actions. TSC will update existing KNOWN or SUSPECI‘ED 'I'ERRORIST records with new
TERRORIST IDENTIFIERS and TERRORISM INFORMATION and will provide the broader
counterterrorism analytic community with as much new information as possible stemming
from an ENCOUNTER with a KNOWN or SUSPECTEI) TERRORIST. TSC’s primary methods for
sharing TERRORISM INFORMATION with the broader counterterrorism analytic community will
be through its EMA application and the use of Intelligence Information Reports (lle), as
described further in Section V, infra. TSC will also coordinate with Fusion Centers on law
enforcement and other ENCOUNTERS impacting their Area of Responsibility. This
coordination will include a request for record enhancing information from the Fusion Center,
which if received, will be added to the subject’s KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST record.

5.14.1 Any new TERRORISM INFORMATION recorded in, or attached to an EMA record by
'I‘SC will be provided to NCTC via an automated ingest process.” Such daily ingests of
EMA records update NCTC’S TIDE to reﬂect the fact of the ENCOUNTER, any new
identiﬁers used to conﬁrm the KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST POSITIVE MATCHES, or
those identified in an HR. Once TIDE has been updated, an automated ingest from
TIDE to TSDB is used to update the various TSDB subsets (e. g., No Fly or Selectee
Lists). At this point, the process is complete and the watchlisting, screening and law

 

8° An “automated ingest" is one where the contents of TSC’s EMA records are incorporated into NCTC‘s 'I‘IDE
database via a system-to-system transfer of information that identiﬁes new or changed information. This process allows
NCTC to spot KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST records that have been amended or updated. This process also
accommodates the transfer of attached ENCOUNTER PACKAGES received from SCREENERS. In those instances, the
ENCOUNTER PACKAGES appear as attachments to the KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST record. ENCOUNTER PACKAGE
attachments must be moved to another system in order to give the broader counterterrorism community access to the
TERRORISM INFORMATION. That process is described in Section V, infra.
