that is descriptive and speciﬁc to an event or activity, and is more than a label. For example,
“Subject X provides false travel documentation for Al—Qaida operatives” is PARTICULARIZED
DEROGA'I‘ORY INFORMATION, whereas “Subject Y is a supporter,” standing alone, is not
considered PARTICULARIZED DEROGATORY INFORMATION.

R. POSITIVE MATCH: occurs when the TSC determines that information about a subject
encountered by a SCREENER exactly or reasonably matches a record in the TSDB.

S. POTENTIAL MATCH: occurs when an ENCOUN’I‘ERING AGENCY believes it has a match with a
KNOWN or SUSPECTEI) TERRORIST record in the TSDB. An ENCOUNTERING AGENCY may attempt
to resolve POTENTIAL MATCHES ﬁrst through its review process. If an ENCOUNTERINO AGENCY’S
review process cannot resolve the individual’s status as not a match to a TSDB record, the
ENCOUNTERING AGENCY will refer the POTENTIAL MATCH to TSC for ﬁnal adjudication.

T. PURELY DOMESTIC TERRORISM INFORMATION: is deﬁned in the TSC MOU as information
about US. PERSONS that has been determined to be PURELY DOMESTIC TERRORISM INFORMATION
with “no link to foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, or international TERRORISM.”

U. REASONABLE SUSPICION: is the standard that must be met in order to include an individual in
the TSDB, absent an exception provided for in the Watchlisting Guidance. To meet the
REASONABLE SUSPICION standard, the NOMINATOR, based on the totality of the circumstances,
must rely upon articulable intelligence or information which, taken together with rational
inferences from those facts, reasonably warrants a determination that an individual is known or
suspected to be or has been knowingly engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid
of, or related to TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. There must be an objective factual
basis for the NOMINATOR to believe that the individual is a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST.
Mere guesses or hunches are not enough to constitute a REASONABLE SUSPICION that an
individual is a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST. Reporting of suspicious activity alone that
does not meet the REASONABLE SUSPICION standard set forth herein is not a sufﬁcient basis to
watchliSt an individual. The facts, however, given fair consideration, Should sensibly lead to the
conclusion that an individual is, or has, engaged in TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.

V. SCREENER: a Department or Agency that is authorized to conduct TERRORISM screening to
determine if an individual is a possible match to a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST in the
TSDB. SCREENERS can include Federal Departments or Agencies, state, local, tribal, territorial,
or foreign governments and certain private entities. The term ‘SCREENER’ is used throughout
this document as a general reference to a government ofﬁcial who compares an individual’s
information with information in the TSDB to determine if an individual is in the TSDB. Law
enforcement ofﬁcials who engage in such activities may normally describe their targeting or
other actions in this context as other than "screening." For ease of reference, government
ofﬁcials who compare an individual’s information with information in the TSDB will be
referred to in the Watchlisting Guidance as a “SCREENER.”

W. SUSPECTEI) TERRORIST: is an individual who is REASONABLY SUSPECTED to be, or has been

engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to TERRORISM and/or
TERRORIST ACTIVITIES based on an articulable and REASONABLE SUSPICION.
