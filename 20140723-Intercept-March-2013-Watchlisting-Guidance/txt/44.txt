3.I4.I Spouses and Children. Spouses and children” ofa KNOWN or SUSPECTED alien
TERRORIST cannot be considered TERRORIS'l‘S without a REASONABLE SUSPICION that they
are engaging or have engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or
related to TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.“ ’l‘he INA provides that the alien
spouse or alien child of an alien who is inadmissible for certain speciﬁed reasons
relating to terrorist activities, ifthe activity causing the alien to be found inadmissible
occurred within the last ﬁve (5) years, is inadmissible.” An alien spouse or child of an
alien who is believed to be inadmissible under the INA for terrorist activities should be
nominated. No additional DEROGATORY INFORMATION (in addition to familial relation)
is required for nomination under this section, ifthe individual meets the below
qualiﬁcations.

314.1 .I To qualify for watchlisting, alien spouses and children ofa KNOWN or
SUSPECTED 'I‘ERRORIST must:

3.14.] .1.I Be an alien (not a US. citizen or national), which includes l_,PRs; and,
3.14. I . I .2 Be an unmarried child under the age of2] or a spouse of an alien.

3.14. I .2 Ex-spouses, widows, or widowers should not be nominated unless there is a
REASONABLE SUSPlClON to believe that they themselves are engaging or have
engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to
TERRORISM and/or TERRORlST ACTIVITIES. Deceased spouses should not be
nominated unless they are speciﬁcally covered in Paragraph 3. I 7.

314.1 .3 Once a spouse or child no longer meets the deﬁnitional requirements under
this section, such an individual should no longer be watchlisted unless there is a
REASONABLE SUSPlClON to believe that the individual is engaging in TERRORISM
and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. For example, ifa child reaches the age onI and
there is REASONABLE SUSPICION to believe he or she was knowingly involved in
'I‘ERRORIST AC'I‘lVlTY by providing material support to a FTO, he or she can remain
watchlisted based upon this DEROGATORY INFORMATION. On the other hand, once
a child ofa KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORlST turns 21 years of age, the individual
should no longer be watchlisted under this exception because he or she is not
considered a child of the KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST and additional
DEROGATORY INFORMATION would be needed to meet the REASONABLE SUSPICION
standard.

 

57 The INA deﬁnes “child" as “an unmarried person under 21 years ofage. . . ." INA § IO|(b)(l)|8 U.S.C. I IOI(b)(I )].
5‘ The discussion in Paragraph 3.14.] is limited exclusively to spouses and children; all other family members
(including mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers) should be nominated for inclusion in the TSDB only ifthere is
DEROGA'I‘ORY INFORMATION that the individual has a close connection to a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST and that
connection meets the REASONABLE SUSPlClON standard. Absent indepcndent DEROGATORY INFORMATION, records for
these individuals may be retained in TIDE for analytic purposes. See Paragraph l.53.2.2 for treatment ofthesc other
family members as “non-TERRORIST” records that may reside in TIDE for analytic purposes but are not exported to the
TSDB (known as TIDE Category Code 160).

59 See INA § 212(a)(3)(B)(i)(lX)l8 U.S.C. l I82(a)(3)(B)(i)(IX)]. While this provision does not apply when the activity
causing the alien to be found inadmissible occurred more than 5 years before the spouse or child’s admissibility is being
considered, the analysis ofthe time limit’s application will be determined by SCREENERS upon ENCOUNTER.
