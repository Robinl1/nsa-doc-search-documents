The minimum substantive derogatory criteria has been restructured to enable the
watchlisting community to more clearly distinguish between watchlisting based on
substantive derogatory criteria that meets the reasonable suspicion standard from
watchlisting for purposes that support immigration and visa screening activities of the
Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State (Chapter 3);

Revised guidance is provided regarding the watchlisting of individuals based on
information provided by a foreign government (Chapter 3);

The guidance contains two additional categories of alien non-terrorists in the databases
maintained by the National Counterterrorism Center and the Terrorist Screening Center to
support immigration and visa screening activities of the Department of Homeland Security
and the Department of State (e.g., individuals who have a deﬁned relationship with the
Known or Suspected Terrorist, but whose involvement with the Known or Suspected
Terrorist’s activities is unknown (TIDE Category Code 50) and aliens for whom
additional intelligence is required (TIDE Category Code 99)) (Chapter 3);

The Implementing Guidelines regarding the No Fly and Selectee List criteria have been
updated and clariﬁed (e.g., Guantanamo Bay detainees are now included on the No Fly
List, as required by 49 U.S.C. Section 449030)(2)(C)(v)) (Chapter 4);

Use of the One Time Waiver Policy is addressed to facilitate travel under controlled
conditions of certain US. Citizen Known or Suspected Terrorists (Chapter 4);

The guidance reflects the creation of the Expanded Selectee List, an export to the
Transportation Security Administration of Known and Suspected Terrorist records within
the Terrorist Screening Database that contain a full name and complete date of birth to
support airline passenger screening (Chapter 4); and

The guidance reflects the authority of the Terrorist Screening Center Director to make
individual watchlist determinations (i.e., placement on the No Fly, Selectee and Expanded
Selectee Lists) during exigent circumstances (Chapter 4).

(U//FOUO) These changes to the Watchlisting Guidance are intended to make the watchlisting
process more ﬂexible, agile, and inclusive in order to respond to additional terrorism threats while
providing the watchlisting community detailed guidance concerning the watchlisting policy of the
US. Government.

(U//FOUO) The 2013 Watchlisting Guidance describes the US. Government's comprehensive
watchlisting policies and process and includes Sensitive Security Information. Accordingly,
Departments and Agencies who received copies of the 20I3 Watchlisting Guidance arc instructed
to carefully control and share the guidance with only those individuals who are directly involved
in the terrorist watchlisting and screening process.
