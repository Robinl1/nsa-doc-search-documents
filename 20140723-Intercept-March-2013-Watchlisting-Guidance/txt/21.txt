TSC Review. TSC personnel will review the nominations received as described in Paragraph
1.56. TSC personnel evaluate whether nominations meet watchlisting standards and weigh, as
appropriate, all-source analysis before accepting or rejecting a nomination. The TSC has a
critical role to play in quality control, as the 'I‘SC review is the last step before any record
(including a biometric nomination where no name is available) is sent to various screening
systems. As with NCTC, the TSC should ensure there is a process in place for review and/or
auditing of TSC nominations and TSC records.

Distinctions between U.S. PERSONS under Executive Order [2333 and Aliens under the
Immigration and Nationality Act. This Watchlisting Guidance generally adopts the
deﬁnition of U.S. PERSON from Executive Order 12333 (as amended) for nomination
procedures. Executive Order 12333 deﬁnes a U.S. PERSON as “A United States citizen, an alien
known by the intelligence element concerned to bc a permanent resident alien, an
unincorporated association substantially composed of United States citizens or permanent
resident aliens, or a corporation incorporated in the United States, except for a corporation
directed or controlled by a foreign government or governments.” The Watchlisting Guidance
also contains certain exceptions to the minimum substantive derogatory standards for
TERRORIST watchlisting that support immigration and visa screening activities by the DI IS and
DOS to determine whether ineligibilities exist for admission to the United States or visa
adjudication pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Because the INA
defInes “aliens” as any person not a citizen or national of the United States, the INA
admissibility provisions also apply to Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs), in certain
circumstances, who are considered U.S. PERSONS under Executive Order 12333.

Consequently, NCTC developed a mechanism in TIDE to identify and distinguish U.S.
citizens from non-U.S. citizens in order to further distinguish between “aliens” under the INA
and U.S. PERSONS under Executive Order 12333.26

()RIGINA'I‘OR’S Nominations Procedures. As mentioned in Paragraph 1.26, when an
ORIGINATOR becomes a NOMINATOR. it prepares a nomination document and forwards it to
NCTC through the NOMINATOR tool.

1.48.1 As a general rule, NCTC will attach all disseminated communications (cables or
forms) to the TERRORIST identities rccord as a “source” document, which will be
available on NCTC Current or the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications
System (JWICS) to individuals who have been granted access to TIDE.

1.48.2 Because NCTC is the conduit for passing international TERRORISM INFORMATION to
TSC for TERRORISM screening purposes, there is no longer a need to send watchlist
requests to multiple Government Agencies. By sending a Terrorist Watchlist
nomination cable to NCTC, all potential U.S. Government TERRORISM screening
