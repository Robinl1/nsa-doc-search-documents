NCTC may discover an individual who is eligible for watchlisting while reviewing all-source
information. In these cases, NCTC analysts will request that the ORIGINATOR submit a
nomination for inclusion into 'I‘IDE; or, on a limited basis or during exigent circumstances,
NCTC analysts may update TIDE directly with a disseminated report and notice to the
ORIGINATOR(S). In instances where disseminated reporting is used to enhance TIDE, NCTC
will provide notice back to the collecting agency via TIDE. TSC may also nominate
TERRORISM INFORMATION received pursuant to TERRORISM screening conducted by foreign
governments.

NCTC and 'I‘SC are responsible for reviewing both newly nominated individuals, as well as
subsets of existing records, to determine if additional and/or enhancement (research) is
required to locate missing information critical to the watchlisting process. In some cases, this
will require research to locate additional DEROGATORY INFORMATION to meet the minimum
substantive derogatory criteria for watchlisting. In other cases, this will require research to
locate additional biographic or biometric identiﬁers, in order to provide a comprehensive
record maximizing the probability of conﬁrming a POSITIVE MATCH to an identity contained in
the TSDB.

AGGREGATORS are those who receive and hold TERRORISM INFORMATION and certain other
non-TERRORISM INFORMATION they are authorized to receive and retain. For example, two of
NCTC’s main statutory missions are to serve as the (1) central and shared knowledge bank on
KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS and (2) primary organization in the US. Government for
analyzing and integrating all intelligence information possessed or acquired by the US.
Government pertaining to TERRORISM and counterterrorism. '9

TSC takes on the role of an AGGREGA’I‘OR when a KNOWN or SUSPECTEI) 'I‘IiRRORIST is
encountered and the individual’s record is enhanced or updated with ENCOUNTER-related
information. As noted in Paragraphs 1.] and 1.7, the TSC manages the watchlisting process
and plays a key role in helping Departments and Agencies determine whether an ENCOUNTER
with a member of the public is one with a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST. Additional
TERRORISM INFORMATION or TERRORIST IDENTIFIERS are generated during ENCOUNTERS and the
Encounter Management Application (EMA)20 uses that information to update records of
KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS.

SCREENERS vet against the TSDB to determine if an individual is a possible match to a KNOWN
or SUSPECTED TERRORIST in the TSDB. SCREENERS can include federal, state, local, tribal,
territorial, or foreign governments and certain private entities. Screening ofﬁcials include
homeland security officers, consular affairs ofﬁcers, transportation safety personnel, and
ofﬁcials of foreign governments with whom the United States has entered into a TERRORISM
SCREENING lNl-‘ORMATION sharing agreement pursuant to HSPD—6. Certain Departments and
Agencies have components which perform both screening and law enforcement duties. If a
