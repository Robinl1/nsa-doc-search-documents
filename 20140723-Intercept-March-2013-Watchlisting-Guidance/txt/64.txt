ENCOUNTERS will be coordinated with the FBI, who will handle them as they do all other
FBI KNOWN or SUSPECTED TI‘IRRORIST ENCOUN'I‘ERS.

5.4.7 Department of Homeland Security Intelligence & Analysis. DHS l&A provides end
products and analytical reports, which are generally available to the NCTC and the
broader counterterrorism analytic community, including fusion centers. DHS l&A
works closely with DHS components to ensure non-traditional streams of information
are fused with traditional sources of information from other members of the [C to give a
complete picture of potential threats to the nation. DHS l&A “connects the dots” for
intelligence reporting and ENCOUNTERS of the DHS components, and as such, has
limited opportunity for ENCOUNTERs with KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTs.

Department of State ENCOUNTERS. For DOS ENCOUNTERs with a person who is a POSITIVE
MATCH to a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST, the DOS unit at the TSC will do the following:

5.5.1 Visa Applications. DOS/TSC will upload the electronic visa application from the CCD
to the individual’s EMA record. DOS/T SC will coordinate with the overseas posts to
scan in CCD all other available DOS documents associated with the individual. DOS
information about whether a visa is issued is currently available in individual case
records in the CCD; DOS is currently investigating upgrades to the CCD’s report
function that will make the visa decision data more easily accessible to TSC and other
users.

5.5.2 Visa Revocations. DOS/TSC will upload the electronic visa application from the CCD
to the individual’s EMA record.

5.5.3 Passports. After encounters with KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS possessing
passports issued by the United States, the TSOC will upload the Passport Information
Electronic Records System (PIERS) application forms from the CCD to the individual’s
EMA record. DOS/T SC will coordinate with the overseas posts to scan in CCD all other
available DOS documents associated with the individual.

United States Agency for International Development ENCOUNTERS. United States Agency
for International Development (USAlD) works in agriculture, democracy and governance,
economic growth, the environment, education, health, global partnerships, and humanitarian
assistance in more than 100 countries. When USAlD receives an application seeking financial
assistance, prior to granting, these applications are subject to vetting by USAlD intelligence
analysts at the TSC. lf USAlD/TSC finds that an application relates to a person who is a
POSITIVE MATCH to a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST in the TSDB, USAID/TSC will provide
any TERRORISM INFORMATION concerning the application and follow standard TSC procedures
for processing TERRORISM INFORMATION, to include logging the ENCOUNTER in EMA.

Foreign Partner ENCOUNTERS. After each ENCOUNTER by a foreign partner, DOS/TSC will
ask the respective country for the subject’s photo, additional biographic data and any
