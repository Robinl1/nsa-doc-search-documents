3‘ Only unclassified phone numbers that are authorized for passage to TSC pursuant to Paragraph 7(m) of Addendum B
to the TSC MOU, will be included in TSDB. See Appendix 4. Unclassified phone numbers will only be provided to
those SCREENERS that have the technical capability to receive this data.

37 Only unclassified email addresses that are authorized for passage to TSC pursuant to Paragraph 7(m) of Addendum B
of the TSC MOU will be included in TSDB. See Appendix 4. Unclassiﬁed email addresses will only be provided to
those SCREENERS that have the technical capability to receive this data.

’8 As required here, there must be two distinct identiﬁers that must be sufficiently speciﬁc to account for the large
number of possible matches common identifiers may produce. For example, ifone identiﬁer is rather common (e.g.,
physical identiﬁers), the other identiﬁer must be more specific to permit the screening ofﬁcial to successfully match a
record with an individual. As a further example, a nomination with the last name listed as Khan, location listed as
Kabul, Afghanistan, and occupation listed as a baker alone would be insufﬁcient for screening purposes because it is
highly unlikely a successful match could be made against such data. However, a nomination with the name listed as R.
Khan, location listed as residence of I23 Sunshine Street, Kabul, Afghanistan, and occupation listed as a baker at ABC
Bakery, would be sufﬁcient for screening purposes.
