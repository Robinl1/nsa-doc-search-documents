This Watchlisting Guidance has been developed to help standardize the watchlisting
community’s nomination and screening processes. It is important to remember, however, that
watchlisting is not an exact science. There are inherent limitations in any primarily name-
based system and analyticjudgments may differ regarding whether subjective criteria have
been met. Given these realities, the US. Government’s watchlisting process attempts to
safeguard the American people from a TERRORIST attack while safeguarding privacy, civil
rights and civil liberties.

Thus, when reasonable minds could disagree on a record, a NOMINATOR will make a
determination in favor of sending the nomination to NCTC for consideration and additional
review. The TSC has the ﬁnal decision authority regarding watchlisting determinations and
will add an individual’s name to the TSDB, consistent with TSC Actions and Processes as
further described in Paragraph l.56.

WATCHLISTING AUTHORITIES

On September I6, 2003, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive 6
(HSl’D-6), which directed the Attorney General to “establish an organization to consolidate
the US Government’s approach to TERRORISM SCREENING and provide for the appropriate
and lawful use of TERRORIST INFORMATION in screening processes.”4 TERRORIST
INFORMATION was speciﬁcally deﬁned to mean “information about individuals known or
appropriately suspected to be or have been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for,
in aid of, or related to TERRORISM.” HSPD-6 also directed the heads of Executive
Departments and Agencies to provide to NCTC on an on-going basis, “all appropriate
TERRORIST INFORMATION in their possession, custody, or control,” to the extent permitted by
law.

The intent of HSPD-6 was to consolidate all TERRORISM INFORMATION at the Terrorist Threat
integration Center (TTlC) — whose functions were assumed by NCTCa — in a classiﬁed
database that would then extract Unclassiﬁed, For Ofﬁcial Use Only (U//FOUO) TERRORIST
IDENTIFIERS for passage to the new organization created by the Attorney General. Thus,
concurrent with the issuance of HSPD-6, the TSC was established via the Memorandum of
Understanding on the Integration and Use of Screening Information to Protect Against
Terrorism (TSC MOU), which was signed by the Attorney General, the Secretaries of State
and Homeland Security, and the Director ofCentral Intelligence (on behalf of the lC).6

Treasury, and Defense also became signatories to the Memorandum of Understanding between the Intelligence
Community, Federal Law Enforcement Agencies, and the Department of Homeland Security Concerning Information
Sharing, dated March 4, 2003 (Information Sharing MOU). By doing so, they agreed that all provisions of the TSC
MOU and the Information Sharing MOU apply to all entities that are or become a part of their respective Departments.
