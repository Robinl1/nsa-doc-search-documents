MEMORANDUM FOR: National Foreign Intelligence
Program Principals

summer: (DI/F000) Homeland Security Information
Sharing Memorandum of Understanding

l. (cl/F000) The Attorney General, Secretary of
Homeland Security. and I have just signed the attached
Memorandum of Understanding on Information Sharing (MOD)
implementing information sharing require-tents of the
Homeland Security Act (Act). It is effective immediately.
As you blow. the Department of Homeland Security
(Department) has now reached critical mass. Our
corresponding intelligence support function has also
matured.

2- (OI/F000) As with much recent huneland security-
:elated work, the drafting process on this high priority
White Eouse initiative moved quickly. Successive drafts
were sent to each of your agencies. with all comments
forwarded directly to the White House drafting team. The
resulting 300 is a fair expression of what the Act requires.
I expect each of you to hold those you supervise accountable
for giving full effect to each of the 2400's provisions.
Note that the MOD makes Associate Director of Central
Intelligence for Homeland Security. Winston P- Wiley my
representative for information sharing under the 2400. He
has my proxy and full support.

3. (Ul/FOUO) Full and efficient implementation of the
MOU will benefit not only the Department, but also
intelligence and law enforcement agencies. As with the
Terrorist Threat Integration Center, we will embrace the
opportunities and challenges it presents.
