the identiﬁcation of new KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS who meet the REASONABLE
SUSPICION standard, along with the identifying and DEROGATORY INFORMATION most useful to
watchlisting, and screening effort, as well as assisting in identity resolution.

Each Department or Agency that nominates a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST to NCTC for
watchlisting is under a continuing obligation to provide NCTC with newly identiﬁed
DEROGATORY INFORMATION or exculpatory information obtained by that Department or
Agency. Each Department or Agency also has the responsibility to provide NCTC with newly
identiﬁed identifying and DEROGATORY INFORMATION obtained from their Department or
Agency, regardless ifthey were the original NOMINATING AGENCY.

With the noted exception of the Visa Viper Program, Departments and Agencies should not
nominate KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS to NCTC based on information that they do not
originate without ﬁrst coordinating with the ORIGINATOR.

VIII. QUALITY CONTROL MEASURES

1.40

In order to produce and maintain the most reliable and accurate information in TIDE, TSDB,
and screening databases, quality control is considered a responsibility of all entities.
NOMINATING DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES must establish and maintain processes, including
appropriate training and guidance, to ensure information transmitted to NCTC is consistent
with the source ofthe information.

HSI’D—6 Requirements. llSPD-6 requires the TSC to maintain thorough, accurate, and
current information concerning KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. For watchlisting purposes,
“current” means information that the NOMINATING AGENCY reasonably believes is valid and
accurate. The requirement that information be current does not necessarily preclude
information that is several years old from being included in the TSDB ifthere is no reason to
believe the information may have changed (e.g., information regarding an individual’s date of
birth or TERRORIST ACTIVITY was collected 20 years ago but has not been superseded by
additional information is still relevant). NOMINATORS should consider the date of the
DEROGATORY INFORMATION in the context of analyzing the overall quality of the data, as well
as the severity of the threat, to determine whether the individual warrants watchlisting. The
date of the DEROGATORY INFORMATION may refer to both the date the information is collected
(such as a report that was collected 50 years ago) as well as the date of the information that is
referenced in the reporting (such as a recent report that references an event that occurred 50
years ago).

TSC MOU Obligations. Paragraph 15 of the TSC MOU provides that the TSC “will
determine, according to criteria established jointly with the entity responsible for each
supported system, which supported screening processes will query that entry in the
consolidated TERRORIST screening database.” Pursuant to that paragraph, the TSC is required
to “make these determinations based on criteria and procedures developed in coordination
with the Parties to this Memorandum and in consultation with the heads of appropriate Federal
