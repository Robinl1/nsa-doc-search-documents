record nomination to ensure it meets the watchlisting standard.31 The SRQ also helps ensure
that all qualiﬁed records are made available to the appropriate SCREENERS for use in
TERRORISM screening. During the SRQ process, every request to add, modify, or delete a
TSDB record is reviewed by a TSC analyst to ensure the accuracy of watchlisting records and
the removal of inaccurate records from TSDB.

1.56.1 Within the TSC’s NDIU, experienced analysts and/or designated Agency
representatives serve as Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) with respect to specific
databases (e. g., No Fly or Selectee List) that receive TSDB data for TERRORISM
screening purposes. The NDlU currently has four types of SMEs who specialize in the
information/systems from their respective organizations: DHS/Transportation Security
Administration (TSA) for the No Fly, Selectee and Expanded Selectee Lists, FBI for
National Crime Information Center (NClC)/KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST File
(KSTF), DOS for the Consular Consolidated Database (CCD)32 and DHS for TECS (and
its components) and the Automated Targeting System (ATS). SMEs provide guidance
regarding their speciﬁc information/systems to the TSC and watchlisting standards to
their Agencies. In some cases, the SME coordinates the data export to the supported
system, provides feedback to NOMINATORS, and responds to inquiries regarding their
supported system from other TSC customer Agencies.

1.56.2 Upon the conclusion of TSC’s review, TSC will either accept or reject the
nomination:

1.56.2.1 Accept Nomination. Consistent with Paragraphs (7) and (8) of Addendum B
