SCREENER believes an individual may be on the Watchlist, the screener contacts the TSC’s
Terrorist Screening Operations Center (TSOC). The TSOC will determine whether the
individual the SCREENER has encountered is, in fact, a POSITIVE MATCH to the individual who
is on the Terrorist Watchlist. The TSOC may also notify the FBl’s Counterterrorism Division
(CTD) that there has been a positive ENCOUNTER with a watchlistcd subject. TSC’s Terrorist
Screening Operations Unit (TSOU) coordinates the appropriate operational response to the
ENCOUNTER. Based on the TERRORISM INFORMATION made available by the ORIGINATING
AGENCY, the SCREENER will take action based upon its specific authorities (e.g., requiring
additional screening at an airport checkpoint, denying a visa application, determining
admissibility into the United States) and follow appropriate ENCOUNTER procedures, as set
forth in Chapter 5.
