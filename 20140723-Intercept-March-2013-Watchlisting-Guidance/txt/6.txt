CHAPTER I: WATCHLISTING PROCESS AND PROCEDURES

I. INTRODUCTION

Li A key foundation for TERRORISTl—related screening is the US. Government’s TERRORIST
watchlisting process managed by the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC). The TSC was
established by the Attorney General, acting through the Director of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI), and in coordination with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of
Homeland Security, and the then Director of Central Intelligence for the lntelligence
Community (lC). The TSC is supported by the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC),
the Department of State (DOS), the Department of Homeland Security (Dl IS), the lC, the FBI,
Law Enforcement Agencies, Regulatory Agencies and Diplomatic Bureaus. The TSC has
created and maintains the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) or Terrorist Watchlist to serve
as the US. Government's consolidated watchlist for TERRORISM SCREENING INFORMATION.

1.2 The current TERRORIST watchlisting process supports the US. Government’s efforts to combat
TERRORISM by: (l) consolidating the US. Government’s Terrorist Watchlist in the TSDB; (2)
helping SCREENERS and intelligence agencies accurately identify individuals on the Terrorist
Watchlist; (3) providing SCREENERS with information to help them respond appropriately
during ENCOUNTERS with KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS; and, (4) subsequently collecting
information about the KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST for use in assessing threats and
conducting investigations.2 The collected information may be incorporated into the Terrorist
ldentities Datamart Environment (TIDE) and TSDB to enhance the records of KNOWN or
SUSPECTED TERRORISTS and may be made available to the wider watchlisting and screening
communities. Today, the TSDB also includes information about certain foreign nationals who
are associated with TERRORISM, TERRORIST ACTIVITY, or KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST(S)
but for whom there is insufficient DEROGATORY INFORMATION to be independently
watchlisted. This may include certain immediate family members of KNOWN or SUSPECTED
TERRORISTS, or known associates of KNOWN or SUSPECTEI) TERRORISTS. These additional
categories of records (also known as exceptions to the REASONABLE SUSPICION standard) are
maintained to support immigration and screening activities primarily conducted by DOS and
DI'IS.

 

' See Appendix I, Deﬁnitions for words or phrases appearing in all capitalized letters throughout this Watchlisting
Guidance.

2 A SCREENER is a Department or Agency that is authorized to conduct TERRORISM screening to determine if; an
individual is a possible match to a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST in the TSDB. The term “SCREENER” is used
throughout this document as a general reference to a government ofﬁcial who compares an individual‘s information
with information in the TSDB to determine ifzan individual is in the TSDB. Certain SCREENERS have components
which perform both screening and law enforcement duties and law enforcement officials who engage in such activities
may normally describe their targeting or other actions in this context as other than "screening." For ease of reference,
government officials who compare an individual’s information with information in the TSDB will be referred to in the
Guidance as “SCREENERS.” The internal guidance set forth herein is not intended to create or confer any rights,
privileges, or beneﬁts in any matter, case, or proceeding. See United States v. Caceres, 440 US. 74 l.

' See Chapter 3, Section V, infra, for more details. Aside from these limited exceptions, references to the TSDB in this
Watchlisting Guidance denote the TSDB as containing information about KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS.
