totality of the information reviewed for nomination. '8 To demonstrate that the
nomination has sufficient indicia of reliability to support this REASONABLE SUSPICION
determination, NOMINATING AGENCIES should implement processes designed to ensure
that nominations are free from errors, that recalled or revised information is reviewed
regularly, and that necessary corrections to nominations based on those
revisions/retractions are made. NOMINATING AGENCIES should, to the extent possible
given the nature of the reporting, verify the accuracy and reliability of the information
included in nominations. In some cases, the NOMINATING AGENCY may not be able to
evaluate the reliability of the information received; however, in such situations, the
NOMINATING AGENCY can ensure that the information provided is an accurate
representation of the information obtained. Chapter 3 sets forth further guidance
regarding the application of the REASONABLE SUSPICION standard to TSDB nominations.

mechanism. ln general, when an ORIGINATOR has identiﬁed international TERRORISM
INFORMATION and determines that information should be provided to NCTC, the ORIGINATOR
takes on the NOMINATOR role. A NOMINATOR is a Federal Department or Agency that has
information to indicate that an individual meets the criteria for a KNOWN or SUSPEC’I‘ED
TERRORIST and nominates that individual to ’l‘lDE and the TSDB based on information that
originated with that Agency.

While all NOMINA'I‘ORS have the duty of upholding informational standards, the NCTC and
