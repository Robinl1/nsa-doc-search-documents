0. OPERATIONALLv CAPABLE: as described in Chapter 4, an individual is “OPERATIONALLY

seeking the opportunity to engage in a violent act of TERRORISM consistent with 18 U.S.C. 2331
or 18 U.S.C. 2332b. For example, attempting to obtain an IED would indicate an individual is
OPERA’I‘IONALLY CAPABLE of committing an act of TERRORISM. However, simply conducting
internet research concerning lEDs would not be sufficient without additional activity.

OPERATIONALLY CAPABLE of committing an act of TERRORISM.
