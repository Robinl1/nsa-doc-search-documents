1.7

Under HSPD—6, consistent with the U.S. Constitution and applicable laws, including those
protecting the rights ofall Americans, the TSC was to develop and maintain an unclassiﬁed
database containing the most thorough, accurate, and current identity information possible
about KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. The TSC created the TSDB to meet these goals.7
The TSDB is also known as the Terrorist Watchlist. The TSDB receives TERRORIST
IDENTIITIERS from two sources: NCTC’s TIDE provides information concerning KNOWN or
SUSPECTED international TERRORISTS and the TSC’s Terrorist Review and Examinations Unit
(TREX) provides the identities of KNOWN or SUSPECTED domestic TERRORISTS who have no
link to international TERRORISM. NCTC’s TIDE contains identifying and substantive
DEROOATORY INFORMATION on KNOWN or SUSPECTED international TERRORISTS and the FBI’s
Sentinel system contains supporting information regarding purely domestic TERRORISTS.

Pursuant to Paragraph (2) of HSPD-6, the NCTC is mandated to “provide [TSC] with access
to all appropriate information or intelligence in the [NCTC’s] custody, possession. or control
that [TSC] requires to perform its functions.” NC'l‘C fulﬁlls this function by providing TSC’s
TSDB with U//FOUO information about KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS from NCTC’s
TIDE and by providing access to TIDE Online, a read-only copy of the TIDE database, to
those in the watchlisting community who require access.

NCTC’s establishment by the President was codiﬁed by section 1021 of the Intelligence
Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA).8 Pursuant to IRTPA, NCTC shall
“serve as the central and shared knowledge bank on KNOWN and SUSPECTED TERRORISTS and
international terror groups.” In addition, NCTC “may, consistent with applicable law, the
direction of the President, and guidelines referred to in [the statute], receive intelligence
pertaining exclusively to domestic counterterrorism from any Federal, State, or local
government or other source necessary to fulﬁll its responsibilities and retain and disseminate
such intelligence.”9

1.9.1 All Departments and Agencies are required to provide NCTC with all TERRORISM
INFORMATION. Due to the amount of information involved, only a subset of this
information is provided in the NCTC prescribed format designed to facilitate direct
ingestion into the TIDE. NOMINATING DEPARTMENTS and AGENCIES, however, should
remain focused on reviewing and watchlisting TERRORISM INFORMATION from datasets
most likely to contain information about KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS.

 

Addendum B to the TSC MOU, which superseded Addendum A, incorporates by reference all provisions ofthe
Information Sharing MOU. See Appendix 5.

7 The TSDB consolidates the U.S. Govemment‘s TERRORISM screening and lookout databases into a single integrated
TERRORIST identities database.

3 NCTC initially was created by Executive Order 13354 (August 27, 2004) to serve as the primary organization in the
U.S. Government for analyzing and integrating all intelligence possessed or acquired by the U.S. Government
pertaining to TERRORISM and counterterrorism, excepting purely domestic counterterrorism information. Executive
Order 13354 was revoked by Executive Order 13470 (July 30, 2008) aﬁer NCTC was codiﬁed in IRTPA section 1021.
9In addition to the provision of domestic KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS directly to the TSC, the TSC's TREX unit
also provides the identities of international KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS to NCTC for inclusion in TIDE.
