FURTHER CLARIFICATION OF THE NO FLY CRITERIA

Third No Fly List Criterion. Prior to the addition ofthe third No Fly List criterion (see
Paragraph 4.5.3), a concern over the breadth of the No Fly List arose when KNOWN or
SUSPECTED TERRORISTS who posed a threat to a U.S. military base overseas did not meet the
criteria for inclusion on the No Fly l.ist. DeSpite national interests, the threat to the overseas
military base did not involve either civil aviation (as set forth in the ﬁrst No Fly List criterion)
or an act of domestic TERRORISM to the homeland (as set forth in the second No Fly List
criterion). “Domestic Terrorism” requires that a subject’s TERRORIST ACTIVITIES occur
primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. “Homeland” does not include
bases and embassies located abroad. Even in those instances when the IC had identified a
KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST’S speciﬁc target, KNOWN or SUSPEC'I‘ED 'fERRORlSTS
maintained the advantage of operational ﬂexibility. The third No Fly List criterion addresses

12 Domestic acts of TERRORISM are those that primarily occur “within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States."
See 18 U.S.C. 233l(5)(C).
