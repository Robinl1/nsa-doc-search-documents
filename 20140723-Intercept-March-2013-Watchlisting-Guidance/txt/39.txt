3.13.1 Individuals Who are Acquitted or for Whom Charges are Dismissed. An
individual who is acquitted or against whom charges are dismissed for a crime related to
TERRORISM may nevertheless meet the REASONABLE SUSPICION standard and
appropriately remain on, or be nominated to, the Terrorist Watchlist.49 Each case should
be evaluated based on the facts of the underlying activities, the circumstances
surrounding the acquittal or dismissal, and all known DIiROGATORY INFORMATION to
determine ifthe individual should remain on the Terrorist Watchlist.

3.13.2 Individuals Identiﬁed as TERRORISTS Pursuant to Other Internal Department or
Agency Processes. Departments or Agencies that nominate individuals associated with
a terrorist group that is not designated by Statute or Executive Order (see Paragraph
3.] 1.2) or groups that fall outside ofthe NIPF-CT construct (see Paragraph 3.] 1.4) must
have internal processes to review the activities of TERRORISTS and terrorist
organizations. So long as a Department’s or Agency’s internal process has determined
that a group is engaging in TERRORISM and/or 'I‘ERRORIST ACTIVITIES, REASONABLE
SUSPICION can be met for members of the group, or active participants in, that group’s
TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. Departments and Agencies that use this clause to recommend
subjects for watchlisting are required to provide written notice to NCTC and TSC (an
email will sufﬁce) ofthe Department or Agency’s determination. While members or
active participants of such groups may be nominated without PARTICULARIZED
DEROGATORY INFORMATION, the watchlisting of an individual pursuant to this clause
must be based on the determination by a Department or Agency’s internal processes that
the group is engaging in TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. Neutral associations
like janitorial, repair, or delivery services of commercial goods do not meet the
REASONABLE SUSPICION standard.

3.13.3 Individuals Identiﬁed as TERRORIS’I‘S Pursuant to Agreements by US.
Government Agencies/Foreign Governments for Sharing of TERRORIST Identity
Data. The US. Government may enter into agreements with foreign governments for
the sharing of TERRORIST identity information. Pursuant to such agreements, data will
be provided to the TSC for TERRORIST screening, as required under l-lSPD-6. The
Information Sharing and Access (ISA) lnteragency Policy Committee (lPC) or an IPC-
designated interagency body, will make a determination, country by country, prior to the
ﬁnal agreement on whether the data provided will (I) be presumed to meet the standard
for inclusion in TSDB; or (2) undergo the Foreign Partner Vetting Process.

3.13.4 Individuals Identiﬁed as Associates or Afﬁliates of KNOWN or SUSPECI‘EI)
TERRORISTS or TERRORIST Cells or Networks.so Individuals who are associated or
afﬁliated with a KNOWN or SUSPECTl-JD TERRORIST, or TERRORIST cells or networks
should be nominated when there is PARTICULARIZED DEROGATORY INFORMATION

 

’9 Because the REASONABLE SUSPICION standard required for watchlisting is lower than that required for a criminal
conviction (i.e., beyond a reasonable doubt), an individual that is acquitted or for whom charges are dismissed may
qualify for watchlisting based on the facts and circumstances surrounding the acquittal or dismissal.

so This section applies as well to persons “linked to,” “related” and other similar descriptors to a KNOWN or SUSPECTED
TERRORIST, TERRORIST cells or networks.
