CHAPTER 2: MINIMUM IDENTIFYING CRITERIA

BIOMETRIC NOMINATIONS

Biometric information refers to the measurable biological (anatomical or physiological) and
behavioral characteristics that can be used for recognition. Examples include facial
photographs, ﬁngerprints, iris scans, digital images, latent prints, DNA and gait. A biometric
is sufficient to meet the minimum identifying criteria for nominations to the NCTC’s TIDE
and/or the TSC’s TSDB, provided that the nomination also meets the minimum substantive
derogatory criteria, or one of the exceptions. Bi0metric nominations without minimum
biographic information will be provided only to those SCREENERS that have the technical
capability to screen against or otherwise make assessments using the biometrics.
Notwithstanding the above, all NOMINATORS are encouraged to include all available associated
biographic information with any biometric nomination.

MINIMUM BIOGRAPIIIC NOMINATION REQUIREMENT

TIDE. NOMINATORS shall provide NCTC, for inclusion into TIDE, FRAGMEN l'ARY
INFORMATION that suggests an individual may have a nexus to TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST
ACTIVITIES and any additional information that will facilitate identification of these
individuals. Nominations to TIDE under this section will be considered for inclusion in the
TSDB if'the NOMINATING AGENCY believes there is REASONABLE SUSPICION to believe that the
individual is a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST.

2.2.1 Nominations of individuals based on FRAGMENTARY INFORMATION who fail to meet the
minimum identifying criteria for nomination to TSDB should be provided to NCTC for
inclusion in ’l‘lDE when there is DEROGA l‘ORY INFORMATION suggesting that the
individual is associated with TERRORISM and the NOMINATING AGENCY determines that
there are sufﬁcient identifiers for possibly facilitating a match to existing TIDE records.
Unless otherwise directed, NOMINATING AGENCIES should prioritize the nominations of
individuals who satisfy the minimum identifying criteria before addressing nominations
based on FRAGMENTARY INFORMATION.

SCREENER Discretion. As appropriate, SCREENERS have the discretion to decide not to
include in their screening systems common names received from the TSDB, where
insufficient identifying information exists for identification.

TSDB. Nominations to the TSDB must include a last name. NOMINATING AGENCIES should
also provide any additional identifying information available. ln addition to a last name,

nominations must include:
