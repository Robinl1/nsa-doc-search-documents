5. l 8 Information Sharing MOU Requirements. Departments and Agencies are reminded of
their agreement to provide transparency between and among them with regard to their
“activities to preempt, prevent, and disrupt 'I‘ERRORIST attacks against U.S. PERSONS and
interests.9l” As a practical matter, that type of transparency demands, to the greatest extent
possible, prior coordination with affected Departments or Agencies before action within a
Department or Agency’s authorities is taken based on TERRORISM INFORMATION from a person
who is a POSITIVE MATCH to a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST. For example, FBI, Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) or DOD, as lead counterterrorism Agencies in their respective
domains, must be consulted prior to taking any action based on ENCOUNTERS with a person
who is a POSITIVE MATCH with KNOWN or SUSPECTEDTERRORIST. This guidance is subject to
existing policies and coordination procedures when action against or pertaining to the KNOWN
or SUSPECTED TERRORIST is contemplated.

5.19 Requests for Withholding of Action. In certain circumstances, law enforcement or the 1C
may request that a SCREENER not take action (e. g., not to refuse the visa, to allow individual to
enter the United States, to not deny an individual to obtain an immigration benefit or access to
the secure area of an airport) although action may be taken under the law. This request, to the
extent practicable, shall be in writing, by a senior official, and include a statement of
justiﬁcation and risk mitigation. Departments and Agencies will establish mutually
acceptable processes and procedures to implement a detailed plan.

VII. EXAMPLES OF TERRORISM INFORMATION TYPICALLY
AVAILABLE FROM ENCOUNTERS

5.20 The following examples of various types of ENCOUNTERS and the type ofinformation typically
generated from those ENCOUNTERS is offered to assist Departments and Agencies in
understanding what additional or new information may become available as a result of
following the guidance provided in this document.

5.20.1 Ports of Entry. Types of documents that could be included in the ENCOUNTER
PACKAGE typically include:
1. Business cards
2. Copies of passport and visa entries

 

9' See Paragraph 3(b) of the Information Sharing MOU (Appendix 5): “Reciprocity and Transparency. All information
collected by any entity relevant to the missions and responsibilities of any other covered entities should be shared, to the
greatest extent possible, between and among all covered entities. Likewise, the parties agree that, to the greatest extent
possible, there should be transparency between and among the covered entities with regard to their activities to preempt,
prevent, and disrupt TERRORIST attacks against U.S. PERSONS and interests. Except as otherwise speciﬁed in this
Agreement, or mandated by relevant Federal statutes or Presidential Directives, procedures and mechanisms for
information sharing, use, and handling Shall be interpreted and implemented consistently and reciprocally regardless of
the role a particular covered entity plays as a provider or recipient of covered information. In other words, for example,
international TERRORISM INFORMATION collected by the Border Patrol should be shared by DHS with the [C to the same
extent foreign intelligence information on TERRORISM is shared by the IC with DHS.”
