UNCLASSIFIED/IFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION

ENCOUNTERS KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS who ﬁle petitions or applications for
immigration beneﬁts internationally and domestically.85 The USClS ofﬁcial contacts
the TSC to report an ENCOUNTER with a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST. Before
making a decision on the immigration application or beneﬁt, USClS contacts the
ORlGlNATOR/NOMINATOR to obtain additional information that may help determine
whether the individual is eligible or ineligible to receive the immigration beneﬁt. In
such cases, USClS seeks further information from the record owner or case agent and
may seek de-classiﬁcation of information relating to the application. In addition, USClS
contacts the ORIGINATOR/NOMINATOR to discuss whether the USCIS decision to grant or
deny the application or benefit would interrupt or negatively affect any ongoing
investigation.

5.4.3.1 USClS maintains a presence at law enforcement and intelligence Agency
entities to further information sharing regarding KNOWN or SUSPECTED
TERRORISTS. USClS maintains information, including the subject’s Alien File (A-
File) and other records. The type of information that may be contained in USClS
ﬁles, including the A—File, could be biometric data (ﬁngerprints and photographs);
identity documents; information relating to the application; addresses, as well as
family and work history information; immigration beneﬁt application information;
and records of previous ENCOUNTERS that DHS has had with the subject. Other
SCREENERS — as well as other appropriate organizations who are considering
nominating a potential KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST or who have ENCOUNTERS
with a person who is a POSITIVE MATCH to a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST— are
advised that they can request, on a case-by-case basis, a copy of the KNOWN or
SUSPECTED TERRORIST’S A-File from USClS if the KNOWN or SUSPECTED
TERRORIST has applied for immigration or citizenship beneﬁts.86

5.4.4 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. lmmigrations and Customs
Enforcement (ICE) is the principal investigative arm of DHS. ICE is also the federal
law enforcement organization responsible for immigration and customs—related
investigations and detention within the interior and at the borders of the United States.
ICE frequently ENCOUNTERS potential KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS during
enforcement activities under its purview. Such ENCOUNTERS are documented within ICE
Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) via the Known Suspected Terrorist
Encounter Protocol and reported to the TSC and lCE’s Homeland Security
Investigations (HSl). ICE HSl Special Agents frequently encounter KNOWN or
SUSPECTED TERRORISTS internationally, domestically, at U.S. POEs, and when KNOWN or
SUSPECTED TERRORISTS are the subjects of an ICE investigation. These ENCOUNTERS are

 

“5 For example. a U.S. PERSON who is a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST may file a petition for a foreign national or a
U.S. PERSON who is not a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST may ﬁle a petition for a foreign national who is a KNOWN or
SUSPECTED TERRORIST.

3" Because USClS is the custodian of information acquired through the immigration process relating to an individual
and because the A-File is not routinely attached to the TSDB or TIDE, a specific request to USClS is necessary in order
to obtain information from the A-File.
