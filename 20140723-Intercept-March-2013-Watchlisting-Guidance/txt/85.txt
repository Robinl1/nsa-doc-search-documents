AA. TERRORISM SCREENING INFORMATION: is defined in the standard HSPD-6 agreement to
mean unclassified identifying information about KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS.

BB. TERRORIST: please see KNOWN TERRORIST or SUSPECTED TERRORIST.

CC. TERRORIST IDENTIFIERS: are referred to in the TSC MOU as U//FOUO data for inclusion
into the TSDB. TERRORIST IDENTIFIERS are data points about a particular identity that include
names and aliases, dates of birth, places of birth, unique identifying numbers, passport
information, country of origin and nationality, physical identiﬁers, addresses, photographs or
renderings of the individual, ﬁngerprints or other biometric data, employment data, license plate
numbers, and any other TERRORISM INFORMATION that ORIGINA'I‘ORS speciﬁcally provide for
passage to the 'l‘ SC.

DD. TERRORIST INFORMATION: as deﬁned in HSPD—6 is “information about individuals known
or appropriately suspected to be or have been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation
for, in aid of, or related to TERRORISM.”

EE. U.S. PERSON: is deﬁned in Executive Order 12333 (as amended) as “a United States citizen,
an alien known by the intelligence element concerned to be a permanent resident alien, an
unincorporated association substantially composed of United States citizens or permanent
resident aliens, or a corporation incorporated in the United States, except for a corporation
directed and controlled by a foreign government or governments.” 'l‘ he Watchlisting Guidance
contains certain exceptions to the minimum substantive derogatory standards for TERRORIST
watchlisting that support immigration and visa screening activities by the DHS and DOS to
determine whether ineligibilities exist for admission to the United States or visa adjudication
pursuant to the INA. Because the lNA deﬁnes “aliens” as any person not a citizen or national of
the United States, the INA admissibility provisions also apply to LPRs, in certain circumstances,
who are considered as US. PERSONS under Executive Order 12333. Consequently, NC'I‘C
developed a mechanism in TIDE to identify and distinguish US. citizens from non-US. citizens
in order to further distinguish between “aliens” under the [NA and US. PERSONS under
Executive Order l2333. See lNA § lOl(a)(3) [8 U.S.C. llOl(a)(3)].
