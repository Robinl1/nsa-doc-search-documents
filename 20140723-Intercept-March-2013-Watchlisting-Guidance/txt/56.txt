VIII. IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

4.15 General Guidelines. The watchlisting community has developed six general guidelines
regarding the No Fly and Selectee Lists that should be rcemphasized in order to effectively
implement the No Fly List and Selectee List criteria. The six general guidelines are:

4.15.1 When evaluating the significance, relevance and validity ofa threat, careful
consideration should be given to the extent to which the threat is current, speciﬁc and
credible.

4.15.2 The Selectee List is not a default position for those who do not qualify for inclusion

on the No Fly List and has distinct elements that must be met before an individual may
be included.

4.15.3 The purpose of the No Fly List is to protect against acts ofTERRORISM; inclusion on
the No Fly List has consequences that are operational, legal, economic, and diplomatic.

4.15.4 Except for expedited nominations made pursuant to Paragraph 1.58 of the
Watchlisting Guidance, the decision to include a person on the No Fly List or Selectee
List must include substantive DEROGATORY INFORMATION that satisﬁes the
aforementioned criteria and thusjustiﬁes inclusion on either list. In cases where
nominations contain no substantive DEROGATORY INFORMATION, or contain insufﬁcient
substantive DEROGATORY INFORMATION, the individual will not be included on either the
No Fly List or Selectee List.

4.15.5 In accordance with determinations made pursuant to Paragraph 1.59 of the

Watchlisting Guidance, the White House may direct the TSC to place categories of
individuals on the No Fly List or the Selectee List on a temporary basis based on current
