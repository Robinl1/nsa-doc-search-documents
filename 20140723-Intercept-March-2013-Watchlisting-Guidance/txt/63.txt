Homeland Security has the authority to refuse visas in accordance with the law and
to assign employees of DHS to diplomatic and consular posts to review visa
applications and conduct investigations.87 ICE, through the Visa Security
Program, exercises this authority. Reviews of visa applications and interviews
with applicants can result in the encounter of KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS,
facilitators, and associates as well as reveal previously unknown information
relating to KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORlSTS. HSI personnel assigned to the Visa
Security Program, and to US. Embassies and Consulates abroad, work closely
with their DOS counterparts to identify KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS and
report ﬁndings through established processes. Finally, ICE may encounter KNOWN

regarding encounters with watchlisted individuals, and will submit relevant
