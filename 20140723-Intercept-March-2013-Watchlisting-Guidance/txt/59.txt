CHAPTER 5: ENCOUNTER MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS

INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE

This guidance addresses the collection, processing, and analysis of TERRORISM INFORMATION
collected by the SCREENERS during an ENCOUNTER with a watchlisted subject. As described
below, all information gathered during an ENCOUNTER with a KNOWN or SUSPECTED
TERRORIST82 is referred to as an ENCOUNTER PACKAGE. This guidance does not create any
new authorities for the collection of any information during ENCOUNTERS with KNOWN or
SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. Rather, it identiﬁes the types of information that a Department or
Agency should consider collecting during an ENCOUNTER with a KNOWN or SUSPECTED
TERRORIST if it possesses the authority to collect such information, and should share with the
interagency community consistent with their legal authorities and executive policy.83

Deﬁnitions.

5.2.1 ENCOUNTER. An ENCOUNTER is deﬁned as an event in which an individual is identiﬁed
during a screening process to be a “POSITIVE MATCH,” “POTENTIAL MATCH,” or
“INCONCI.USIVE MATCH,” to an individual who has been designated in the TSDB as a
KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST. An ENCOUNTER can be a face-to-face meeting with a
KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST, electronic or a paper-based ENCOUNTER (e. g., the
KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST has submitted an application for a beneﬁt liked a visa,
Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) application, or information is
provided to the United States by a foreign government, aircraft operator, or other private
entity). Chapter 5 is only concerned with POSITIVE MATCHES, which occur when the
l‘SC determines that information about a subject encountered by a SCREENER matches a
TSDB record.

5.2.2 TERRORISM INFORMATION. TERRORISM INFORMATION in this chapter includes purely
domestic terrorism as deﬁned in the TSC MOU and incorporates the deﬁnition found in
in section 1016 of the lRTPA (6 U.S.C 485), as amended. The term “TERRORISM
INFORMATION” means —

5.2.2.1 all information, whether collected, produced, or distributed by intelligence,
law enforcement, military, homeland security, or other activities relating to~~

5.2.2.1.] the existence, organization, capabilities, plans, intentions,
vulnerabilities, means of ﬁnance or material support, or activities of foreign
or international terrorist groups or individuals, or of domestic groups or

 

32 Sharing information for reasons not related to KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST categories should be limited to
updating biographic identifiers, and the sharing of relevant information that may assist in making decisions related to a
change in a person's status in the TSDB and/or TERRORISM INFORMATION.

33 Obligations include those imposed by lRTPA section 1021 or by interagency agreement (e. g., the Information
Sharing MOU (Appendix 5), the TSC MOU (Appendix 3) and Addendum B to the TSC MOU (Appendix 4)).
