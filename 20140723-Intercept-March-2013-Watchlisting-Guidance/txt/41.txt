3.| 3.6 Individuals who Incite Others to Commit Acts of TERRORISM.“ lnciting an
individual to commit an act of TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES under
circumstances that indicate an intention to cause death or serious bodily harm is
considered engaging in TERRORIST ACTIVITY and is sufﬁcient to meet the REASONABLE
SUSPICION standard. The nomination should include PARTICULARIZED DEROOATORY
INFORMATION concerning the type of“incitement” involved and the role of the
individual when this information is known. Normally, speech will not rise to the level of
“inciting” unless there is a clear link between the Speech and an actual effort to
undertake the TERRORIST ACTIVITY. The individual may have incited TERRORIST
ACTIVITY, even if a terrorist attack does not actually occur (e. g., because an attempt to
commit such activity is thwarted). Speech advocating a violent or dangerous TERRORIST
ACTIVITY is incitement if such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent
lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.52

individual capacity or as a member of an organization, any individual who solicits
another to engage in a TERRORIST ACTIVITY and/or for membership in a terrorist
organization is considered to be engaging in TERRORIST ACTIVITY. Nominations that
include PARTICULARIZED DEROOATORY INFORMATION concerning the type of solicitation
involved and the role of the individual are sufﬁcient to meet the REASONABLE SUSPICION
standard. An individual may fall outside the scope of engaging in the solicitation of an
individual for membership in a terrorist organization ifthere is information that
demonstrates that the individual did not know and should not have reasonably known
that the organization was a terrorist organization.

opposed to information about why the organization is a DTO.

is operational in nature. If support is merely ideological, the individual should not
be nominated.

exception to the REASONABLE SUSPICION standard. See Paragraph 3.l4.3.
