'I‘IiRRORIS'I‘S designated as No Fly or associated with violent activity; or at the request of
any Department or Agency that identiﬁes a need.

5.17 Results of INITIAL REVIEW, ADVANCED ANALYSIS, and TARGETED ANALYSIS efforts
(collectively, “Exploitation”) by Departments or Agencies will be reported to the watchlisting,
screening and counterterrorism communities using standard templates when available.

5.17.1 TSC Actions.

5.17.1.1 First Stage Review. 'I‘SC actions with KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST
ENCOUNTERS occur in two stages. The ﬁrst stage occurs when the ENCOUNTERING
AGENCY and TSC exchange TERRORIST IDENTIFIERS to determine whether the
individual is watchlisted (i.e., a POSITIVE MATCH to a TSDB record). TSC records
any new TERRORIST IDENTIFIERS provided during this stage in TSC’s EMA
application.

5.17.1.2 Second Stage Review. The second stage occurs after TSC has conﬁrmed
there is a POSITIVE MATCH to a KNOWN or SUSPECTED 'l‘ERRORlST. For each
POSITIVE MATCH to a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST, the TSC’s Office of
Intelligence ('I‘SC/Ol) will generate an HR for dissemination to the
counterterrorism community that provides a summary about the KNOWN or
SUSPECTED TERRORIST ENCOUNTER (e. g., basic facts about the ENCOUNTER such as
date, time, and place). If available at the time the initial [IR is prepared, TSC/OI
will conduct an INITIAL REVIEW of the ENCOUNTER PACKAGE and provide a
thumbnail summary of the TERRORISM INFORMATION. For example, a summary
might highlight the existence of a new KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST (“KNOWN
or SUSPECTED TERRORIS’I‘ was traveling with three other associates not previously
identiﬁed in the car where the explosives were found in a hidden compartment”) or
the possibility that new TERRORIS’I‘ IDENTIFIERS are available (“approximately 80
pages carried by the KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST were converted to electronic
documents ranging from the KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST’S calendar/address
book to bank account and credit card numbers”).

5.17.2 National Media Exploitation Center Actions. Much ofthe TERRORISM
INFORMATION generated by ENCOUNTERS from a person who is a POSITIVE MATCH to a
KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST is expected to be in a foreign language that may hinder
prompt exploitation. The National Media Exploitation Center (NM EC) has the
capability to translate foreign language information and the experience necessary to
understand the efforts used to hide their activities. When TSC receives ENCOUNTER
PACKAGES with information in a foreign language, or when NCTC receives them
directly from an ENCOUNTERING AGENCY, TSC or NCTC will forward/notify NMEC that
it has the action to translate the ENCOUNTER PACKAGE. Once the ENCOUNTER PACKAGE
has been translated and returned to TSC and NCTC, the assigned roles and responsibility
for exploitation will apply.
