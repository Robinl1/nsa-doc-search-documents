1.13

(HSPD—l 1), which “builds upon HSPD-6,” to enhance TERRORIST-related screening to more
effectively detect and interdict SUSPECTED TERRORISTS and TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. HSPD-I I
deﬁnes “SUSPECTED TERRORISTS” as “individuals known or reasonably suspected to be or have
been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to TERRORISM . . .
and TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.”

To enhance information sharing, another key component of the consolidated terrorist
watchlisting system, the President issued Executive Order 13388, which provides that the
head of each Agency that possesses or acquires TERRORISM INFORMATION shall promptly give
access to tllz)at information to the head of each other Agency that has counterterrorism
functions.

On June 5. 2008. the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive 24 (HSPD-
24) to further build upon the TERRORIST screening policies announced in HSPD—6 and HSPD-
l l to protect the nation from TERRORISTS by enhancing the use of biometrics. ln HSPD-24,
the President directed that “. . . agencies, shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, make
available to other agencies all biomctric and associated biographic and contextual information
associated with persons_ for whom there is an articulable and reasonable basis for suspicion
that they pose a threat to national security” (emphasis added). HSPD—24 underscores the
value of biometrics in achieving effective TERRORISM screening and emphasizes the need for a
layered approach to identiﬁcation and screening of individuals, as no single mechanism is
sufﬁcient.

The relevant TERRORISM screening Presidential Directives use words and phrases to describe a
KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST subject to TERRORIST screening without deﬁning them:
“TERRORIST INFORMATION” (HSPD-6), “TERRORISM” (HSPD-6), “appropriately suspected”
(HSPD—6), “reasonably suspected” (HSPD—l 1), and “articulable and reasonable basis for
suspicion” (HSPD-24). Thus, previous watchlisting guidance supplied deﬁnitions of key
terms and the standard that would apply to terrorist watchlisting decisions.

Neither HSPD-6 nor HSPD-I I deﬁnes “TERRORISM and/orTERRORIST ACTIVITIES.” While
federal law contains numerous deﬁnitions of“terrorism””, for watchlisting purposes under
this Guidance, “TERRORISM and/0r TERRORIST ACTIVITIES” combine elements from various
federal deﬁnitions and are considered to:

1.14.1 involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure

 

'0 See Appendix 6, Executive Order 13388.

” See 50 U.S.C. 1801(c) (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) deﬁnition of“intemational terrorism”);
Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) § 212(a)(3)(B)(iii) [8 U.S.C. 1 182(a)(3)(B)(iii)] (deﬁning “terrorist activity”);
lNA §212(a)(3)(B)(iV) [8 U.S.C. 1 182(a)(3)(B)(iV)] (deﬁning to “engage in terrorist activity”); 18 U.S.C. 2331(1)
(deﬁning “international terrorism”); 18 U.S.C. 2332(b) (deﬁning “federal crime ofterrorism”); Executive Order 13224,
66 Fed. Reg. 49079 (September 23, 2001 ) (deﬁning “terrorism”).
