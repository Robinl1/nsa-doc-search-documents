1.33 The arrows fade inside the TSDB cylinder because not every nomination from NCTC (for
international TERRORISM) or the FBI (for domestic TERRORISM) is exported from the TSDB to
SCREENERS (represented by the multi-colored blocks at the far right of the chart).2| For
example, certain categories of individuals that do not meet the minimum identifying criteria
(see Chapter 2, Section II) or the REASONABLE SUSPlClON standard (see Chapter 3, Section II)
can be watchlisted to support immigration and visa screening activities by DHS and DOS (see
Chapter 3, Section V) but are not exported to state/local/tribal SCREENERS or foreign partners.
Similarly, when ORlGlNATORS provide FRAGMENTARY INFORMATION to NCTC for inclusion in
TIDE, such information will not be exported from TIDE to the TSDB, unless the NOMlNATlNG
AGENCY believes there is REASONABLE SUSPlClON to believe that the individual is a KNOWN or
SUSPECTED TERRORIST. FRAGMENTARY INFORMATION is provided to NCTC where it can be
further analyzed, connected to existing information, and added to TIDE for export to TSDB
because NCTC, and not individual ORlGlNATORS, has access to all the information available to
the US Government on a KNOWN or SUSPEC’I‘ED TERRORIST.

VII. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITES FOR THE WATCHLISTING AND SCREENING
COMMUNITY

1.34 Delineation of roles and responsibilities of NOMlNATlNG AGENCIES, SCREENERS, NCTC, and
the TSC is critical to provide for an effective and efficient integrated Terrorist Watchlist
enterprise. While IISPD-6 describes the broad mandate of developing an integrated watchlist
system. and the TSC MOU provides a level of detail needed to fulﬁll that mandate, further
clariﬁcation is required to ensure there are neither gaps in the nomination process, nor
wasteful redundancies.

1.35 Pursuant to l-lSPD-6, Departments and Agencies in the Executive Branch are required, to the
extent permitted by law, to provide TERRORIST INFORMATION to NCTC. This process will be
accomplished either through direct nomination to NCTC, or through a speciﬁc component
designated by a Federal Department or Agency head for doing so (e. g., all DOJ components
are directed to nominate through the FBI; DHS Intelligence and Analysis (l&A) has oversight
responsibility for all DHS nominations). Except as detailed in the sections applicable to
expedited nominations (see Paragraphs 1.58 and 1.59), NOMlNATlNG AGENCIES will endeavor
to provide comprehensive nominations and include the maximum amount of identifying and
DEROGATORY INFORMATION.22 NOMlNATlNG DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES should prioritize

 

2' The Terrorist Screening Database Annex D to the FBI Memorandum of Understanding with Department of Defense
(DOD), signed February 22, 2012, established DoD as a screening agency customer ofthe TSC. The dashed line in the
latter chart represents that DoD is ﬁnalizing procedures to receive and use information from the TSDB for its screening
processes.

In May 2010, the Deputies asked that NOMlNATlNG AGENCIES “ensure that nominations are comprehensive and
include the maximum amount ofidentilying and DEROGATORY INFORMATION." In 2012, the lnteragency Policy
Committee (IPC), in coordination with NOMINATORS, SCREENERS, NCTC and TSC, developed a prioritized list ofdata
identiﬁers that are critical to screening and identity resolution activities. This Identity Resolution and Enhancement
Tiers document is available on NCTC’s Watchlisting Community of Interest portal on the Joint Worldwide Intelligence
Communications System (JWICS).
