CONTEMPLATED BASED ON INFORMATION FROM ENCOUNTERS
WITH A KNOWN OR SUSPECTED TERRORIST

 

90 Under governing authorities, the FBI can conduct “assessments” for an authorized purpose, such as obtaining
information about a threat to national security, without a particular factual predication. To open an investigation —
whether a “preliminary” or “full" investigation — there must be a specific factual predication.
