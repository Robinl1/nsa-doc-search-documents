SOS). NCTC will retain a record in TIDE if it is determined that the information pertains
to, or is related to, TERRORISM.64 However, ifa record involving an alien, which
includes LPRS, does not contain sufﬁcient DEROGATORY INFORMATION to meet any of
the aforementioned exceptions to the TSDB’S REASONABLE SUSPICION standard for
inclusion, NCTC will generally designate the record as a Category Code 99 (the TIDE
category code “applied when DEROGATORY INFORMATION does not meet the
REASONABLE SUSPICION standard for watchlisting because it is very limited or of
suspected reliability but there is a possible nexus to TERRORISM”) or a Category Code 50
(the TIDE category code applied when an individual has a defined relationship with the
KNOWN or SUSPECTEI) 'l‘ERRORlST, but whose involvement with the KNOWN or SUSPECTED
TERRORIST’S activities is unknown)“, making it available for export to TSDB for use by
DOS and DHS for visa adjudication and immigration processing.
