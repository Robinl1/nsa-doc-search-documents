1.63 If the NOMINATOR requesting removal of an international TERRORIST identity record from
TlDE is the only NOMINATOR to have provided information on that record, the removal request
will be immediately processed by NCTC. The removal information is then sent to the TSC,
which, in turn, makes a determination regarding removal of the TERRORIST identity from the
TSDB.

1.64 If multiple NOMINATORS have provided information on an international 'I‘ERRORIST identity
record, NCTC will coordinate with all relevant parties in an attempt to reach a consensus on

reasonably suspected of engaging in TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, or an
