(U//FOUO) NSA OIG conducted oversight of PSP activities from August
2002 until the Program ended in January 2007. It issued 12 formal reports
and 14 Presidential Notiﬁcations on PSP activities at NSA.

Investigations were conducted in response to speciﬁc incidents or
violations to determine the cause, effect, and remedy.

Reviews were conducted to determine the adequacy of management
controls to ensure compliance with the Authorization and related
authorities; to assess the efficiency and effectiveness in mitigating
high-risk activities associated with the Program; and to identify
impediments to satisfying the requirements of the Authorization and
related authorities.

Presidential Notifications were drafted for the Director’s signature
to notify the President’s Counsel about violations of the
Authorization. (See below for additional details.)

Monthly Due Diligence Meetings were held by program officials
to exercise “due diligence” in addressing program issues and
developments. The OIG attended these meetings to stay aware of
program activities.

(U//FOUO) OIG also provided oversight of FISC-authorized activity
previously conducted under Authorization.

(U//FOUO) See Appendix H for a list of OIG reports on PSP activity at
NSA.
