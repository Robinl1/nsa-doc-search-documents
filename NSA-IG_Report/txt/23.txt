(U) THREE: ACCESS TO LEGAL REVIEWS, THE
AUTHORIZATION, AND INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROGRAM

(U//FOUO) NSA did not have access to the original OLC legal
opinion, but did have access and provided input to an OLC opinion
prepared in 2004. The original Authorization and renewals were kept
in the NSA Director’s safe, and access to the documents was tightly
controlled. By January 2007, nearly 3,000 people had been briefed
on the PSP, including members of Congress and the FISC.

(U) Access to Legal Reviews

 

(TS//SI//NF) The NSA did not have access to the early DoJ Office of
Legal Counsel (OLC) opinions supporting the Attorney General’s
statement that the PSP was legal. General Hayden, NSA lawyers, and the
NSA Inspector General agreed that it was not necessary for them to see the
early opinions in order to execute the terms of the Authorization, but felt it
would be helpful to do so. NSA was, however, given access and provided
comments to the OLC opinion issued in 2004.

(U) Access to OLC’s Original Legal Review

(TS//SI//NF) Two NSA requests for access to the original OLC legal
opinion were denied.

(TS//SI//NF) First Request. NSA General Counsel Robert Deitz stated that
he asked the Vice President’s Counsel if he could see the opinion. Even
though Mr. Deitz’s request was denied, the Vice President’s Counsel read a
few paragraphs of the opinion to him over the classiﬁed telephone line]

(TS//SI//NF) Second Request. At a 8 December 2003 meeting with the
DoJ Associate Deputy Attorney General to discuss collection of metadata
and an upcoming NSA OIG compliance audit, NSA’s IG and Deputy GC
requested to see the OLC legal opinion. The Counsel to the Vice President,
who unexpectedly attended the meeting, denied the request and said that
any request to see the opinion had to come directly from General Hayden.

(TS//SI//NF) General Hayden stated he never asked for or read the OLC
legal opinion supporting the PSP. The Deputy GC stated that it was his
