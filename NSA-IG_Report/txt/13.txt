WORKING DRAFT

(U) Early Operations

 

(TS//SI//NF) Within one week, approximately 90 NSA employees were
cleared for access to the PSP. On 11 October 2001, the Associate General
Counsel for Operations and the NSA Deputy General Counsel were cleared
for the Program and agreed with the NSA General Counsel’s determination
that the Authorization was legal. NSA OGC did not formally document its
opinions or legal rationale (see Appendix D).

(TS// SI—STLW/lN F) The MAC was created to analyze metadata obtained
under PSP authorization. By 7 October 2001, it was a 24-hour 7-day a
week watch center with 20 analysts, reporters, and software developers
working in three shifts. Many MAC employees were former Russian trafﬁc
analysts with manual call chaining analysis experience. Initially, the MAC
reported directly to General Hayden and the Deputy Director. The MAC
Chief briefed the Director every week, and the Deputy Director visited
MAC spaces for a brieﬁng each evening.

(TS//SI//NF) While the MAC was setting up to analyze PSP metadata, the
Counterterrorism (CT) Product Line was realigning to conduct PSP content
tasking and analysis. The MAC and the CT Product Line worked closely
together to coordinate efforts and share information. The CT Product Line
was growing rapidly as handpicked employees were moved to support the
new mission.

(TS//SI//NF) Within 30 days, the PSP was fully operational. While
awaiting delivery of requested computer servers, the FBI and CIA gave
NSA lead telephone numbers, and the MAC was able to immediately chain
within the United States with SIGINT collected overseas. Private sector
partners began to send telephony and Internet content to NSA in October
2001. They began to send telephony and Internet metadata to NSA as early
as November 2001.

(U/IFOUO) On-Going Operations

 

(TS//SI//NF) After operations began and it became evident that the
Authorization was likely to be renewed indeﬁnitely, NSA management
became increasingly focused on designing processes and procedures to
implement the Program effectively and to ensure compliance with the
Authorization.
