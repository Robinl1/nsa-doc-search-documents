WORKING DRAFT

(U) TWO: IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AUTHORITY AND
RESULTING SIGINT PRODUCT

(TS//SI//NF) General Hayden said that although he felt comfortable
exercising the Presidential authorization and believed it to be legal, he
recognized that it was politically sensitive and controversial and would be
subjected to scrutiny at some point in time. He and NSA leadership strove
to ensure that NSA personnel executed the terms of the Authorization with
care and diligence and that they not go beyond that which was authorized.
PSP—related operations began on 6 October. Early on, personnel worked
under the assumption that the Authorization was temporary and that
operations would stop in the near future. After it became evident that the
Authority would be continuously renewed, management focused on
designing processes and procedures for Program activity.

(UllFOUO) Stand Up of Operations

(TS/lSI/lNF) On 4 October 2001, after receiving the Authorization, General
Hayden informed the SIGINT Director and other key personnel of NSA’s
new authorities and asked the NSA General Counsel if the Authorization
was legal. The General Counsel said that the next day, 5 October, he told
General Hayden that he believed it was legal (see Appendix D).

(TS//SI//OC/NF) Under General Hayden’s direction, immediate steps were
taken to implement the temporary authority.

A 24-hour watch operation, the Metadata Analysis Center (MAC),
was created in the Signals Intelligence Directorate (SID).

The ﬁrst Program Manager was identiﬁed and informed of his new
responsibilities.

A cadre of experienced operational personnel was chosen to
implement the Program.

Office space was identiﬁed to accommodate newly assigned
personnel.
