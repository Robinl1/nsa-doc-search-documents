WORKING DRAFT

letter to the Counsel for Intelligence Policy dated 12 January 2005, Judge
Kollar—Kotelly stated that, on that date, she was also shown a short legal
memorandum, prepared by the Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the
DoJ, OLC, that set out a broad overview of the legal authority for
conducting the PSP. Judge Kollar—Kotelly added that she was allowed to
read the memorandum but not to retain it for study.

(TS//SI//NF) NSA records show that Judge Kollar—Kotelly was briefed
again on 12 August 2002 at the White House. Although we found no
documentation of the purpose of the meeting or topics discussed, Judge
Kollar—Kotelly stated in the January 2005 letter to the Counsel for
Intelligence Policy that, at her request, she was permitted to review the
Authorization of the PSP on that date.

(TS//SI//NF) In response to a New York Times “warrantless wiretapping”
story published in December 2005, General Alexander briefed all FISC
members on the PSP on 9 January 2006.9

(U) Transition of PSP Authorities to FISC Orders

 

(TS//SI//NF) The transition of PSP-authorized activities to FISC orders
was precipitated by preliminary results of DoJ OLC legal review of the
components of the Program. In March 2004, OLC found three of the four
types of collection authorized under the PSP to be legally supportable.
However, it determined that, given the method of collection, bulk Internet
metadata was prohibited by the terms of FISA and Title III.lo
Consequently, the White House Counsel rather than the Attorney General
signed the 11 March 2004 Authorization.
