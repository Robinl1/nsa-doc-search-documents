WORKING DRAFT

(U) FOUR: NSA PRIVATE SECTOR RELATIONSHIPS

(TS//Sl//NF) To conduct foreign intelligence-gathering activities
under the PSP: NSA required the assistance of private companies,
which provided access to international communications chokepoints
in United States. Immediately after 11 September 2001, some private
companies contacted NSA to offer support. Subsequent to PSP
authorization, NSA sent request letters to companies stating that
their assistance was authorized by the President with legal
concurrence of the Attorney General.

(U) Need for Private Sector Cooperation

 

(TS//SI//NF) The United States carries out foreign intelligence activities
through a variety of means. One of the most effective means is to partner
with commercial entities to obtain access to information that would not
otherwise be available.

(U//FOUO) Telephony

(TS//SI//NF) Most international telephone calls are routed through a small
number of switches or “chokepoints” in the international telephone
switching system en route to their ﬁnal destination. The United States is a
major crossroads for international switched telephone traffic. For example,
in 2003, circuit switches worldwide carried approximately 180 billion
minutes of telephone communications. Twenty percent of this amount,
over 37 billion minutes, either originated or terminated in the United
States, and another thirteen percent, over 23 billion minutes, transited the
United States (neither originating nor terminating here). [NSA is
authorized under Executive Order 12333 to acquire transiting telephone
calls]

(TS//SI//NF) NSA determined that under the Authorization it could gain
access to approximately 81% of the international calls into and out of the

United States through three corporate partners: COMPANY A had access to
39%, COMPANY B 28%, and COMPANY C 14%. NSA did not seek

assistance from local exchange carriers, because that would have given
NSA access primarily to domestic calls.
