(U) FIVE: NSA’S INTERACTION WITH THE FISC AND
TRANSITION TO COURT ORDERS

(TS//Sl//NF) Until 2006, NSA’s PSP-related interaction with members of
the FISC was limited to informational brieﬁngs to the Chief Judge. Chief
Judge Royce Lamberth, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, who replaced Judge
Lamberth as Chief Judge in May 2002, and one law clerk were the only
members of the FISC that NSA had briefed on the PSP. In the spring of
2004, NSA’s interaction with Judge Kollar-Kotelly increased as NSA and
DoJ began transitioning PSP-authorized activities to FISC orders in 2004.
It was not until after parts of the PSP were publicly revealed in

December 2005 that all members of the FISC were briefed on the
Program.

before the FISC the factual and legal issues arising from the PSP in any
case or controversy. Therefore, the FISC did not express any View or
comment on the legality or illegality of the PSP.

of the FISC in January 2002. General Hayden stated that on 31 January
2002, he provided Judge Lamberth a very detailed PSP brieﬁng, and the
Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the DoJ OLC explained the
Program’s legality. General Hayden stated that this brieﬁng was prompted
by a concern expressed by DOJ that PSP-derived information would be
used in FISA applications

(TS/lSI/lNF) On 17 May 2002, General Hayden briefed incoming Chief
Judge Kollar-Kotelly, with Judge Lamberth in attendance, on the PSP. In a
