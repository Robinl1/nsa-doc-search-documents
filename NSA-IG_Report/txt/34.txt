and Chief of Staff requested a written Attorney General opinion on the
legality and lawfulness of the PSP, to include a directive to comply.

President under Article II of the Constitution. Additionally, the Attorney
General directed COMPANY C to comply with NSA’s request.

Internet metadata collection (as well as content collection and telephony
metadata collection) were approved for form and legality by the Attorney
