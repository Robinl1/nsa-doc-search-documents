(TS//SI//NF) NSA leadership considered selectors for targets located in the
United States to be extremely sensitive. As such, processes were set up to
ensure strict compliance with the terms of the Authorization. The
following describes the general process for tasking, collecting, storing and
reporting telephony and Internet content under the PSP. (See Appendix F
for a ﬂowchart of the end-to-end process.)

(TSI/SU/STLW/lNF) Tasking Approvals. Under the PSP, each domestic
selector tasked for content collection was formally approved and tracked.
Analysts submitted content collection requests, also called tasking
packages, to the Chief of CT for approval. Tasking packages contained a
narrative analysis, conclusion, supporting information, documentation, and
a checklist of package contents. In the Chief’s absence, the Deputy Chief
of CT or the Program Manager could approve the requests. The approving
officials reviewed the tasking packages to ensure that the proposed target
and related metadata selectors met criteria in the Authorization. If criteria
were not met, the ofﬁcials requested additional information or denied the
request. In limited cases, collection was approved for speciﬁc time
periods. If the content contained foreign intelligence, the time period for
collection would be extended. If it did not, collection was stopped. All
approvals were documented in tasking packages.
