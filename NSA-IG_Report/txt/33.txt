(TS//SI-ECI//NF) 2001. In his ﬁrst PSP-related letter on 16 October 2001
to COMPANIES A, B and C, General Hayden stated that the National
Security Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation required their
assistance “to collect intelligence vital to the national security arising from
the events of 11 September 2001,” and speciﬁcally requested that they
“provide survey, tasking and collection against international traffic, some
of which terminates in the United States; provide aggregated call record
information; and supply computer to computer data which can be used to
determine the communicants.” Their assistance was “needed to identify
members of international terrorist cells in the United States and prevent
ﬁiture terrorist attacks against the United States.” These ﬁrst letters also
stated that the requested assistance was authorized by the President with
the legal concurrence of the Attorney General, pursuant to Article II of the
Constitution.

(TS// SI-ECII/N F) 2002: Subsequent letters were sent to COMPANIES A,
B, and C by General Hayden (or his deputy) each time the President
reauthorized the PSP. Throughout 2002, these written requests for
assistance referenced the 16 October letter; repeated the need to provide
the Presidentially-authorized assistance; emphasized that such assistance
was necessary to counter a future terrorist attack; and stated that such
assistance was reviewed by the Attorney General and had been determined
to be a lawﬁll exercise of the President’s powers as Commander-in—Chief.
Starting in mid-2003, the wording of the letters was revised but in
substance remained the same.

(TS/l SI-ECI/fN F) Two request letters for assistance were sent to private
sector COMPANY E. The ﬁrst letter was sent on 26 February 2002, and
