to perform assigned job duties. The Program Manager questioned access
requests with unclear justiﬁcations. Approved requests were forwarded to
the Program security ofﬁcer, who performed a security check. If the
security check yielded nothing to impede access, individuals were
instructed to go to the security ofﬁce to read the “Security Pre-Brief
Agreement” and sign a “Sensitive Compartmented Information
Nondisclosure Agreement” form. NSA’s General Counsel also had the
authority to read in Attorneys from other agencies.

(TS//SI//NF) On 20 May 2005, the Program Manager changed the PSP
clearance request and re-certiﬁcation process. The Project Security Ofﬁcer
assigned to Special Source Operations in the SIGINT Directorate assumed
responsibility for the PSP clearance process. (Special Source Operations
managed all PSP-related collection for NSA.) Additionally, the Program
Manager initiated monthly PSP clearance brieﬁngs.

(TS//SI//NF) From 4 October 2001 until 23 May 2005, a two—level PSP
clearance structure was used. One level was limited to the “fact of”
Program existence. A second level included access to PSP targeting data
through a “must know” principle. Access lists were maintained in the SSO
Security Director’s ofﬁce on an internal SSO compartmented LAN.

(TS//SI-ECI//NF) Regular zero-based reviews were conducted by the SSO
Security Director’s ofﬁce quarterly to validate that cleared individuals had
a continuing need for access to PSP information. The clearance did not
automatically transfer with individuals who moved to new assignments.
The clearance had to be re-justified for the new position, or the individual
would be debriefed from the Program.
