(C) Second, in March 2003, the IG advised General Hayden that he should
report violations of the Authorization to the President. In February of
2003, the OIG learned of PSP incidents or violations that had not been
reported to overseers as required, because none had the clearance to see the
report.

(TS//SI//OC/NF) Before March 2003, NSA quarterly reports on
intelligence activities sent to the President’s Intelligence Oversight Board
(through the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Intelligence
Oversight) stated that the Director was not aware of any unlawful
surveillance activities by NSA other than that described in the report.
Beginning in March 2003, at the IG’s direction, NSA quarterly reports
stated that except as disclosed to the President, the Director was not aware
of any unlawful surveillance activities by NSA. Also beginning in March
2003, PSP violations, including those not previously reported to the
Intelligence Oversight Board, were reported in “PresidentialNotiﬁcations.”
(U//FOUO) Third, shortly after learning about the Program, the IG
participated in a September 2002 meeting of key cleared personnel at
which important PSP matters were discussed. He recommended that these
types of meetings be held every month. As a result, monthly “due
diligence” meetings were held until the Program ended.
