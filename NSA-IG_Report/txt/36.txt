engineering). Records included all call events from the companies’ long
distance and international communication networks. The Call Detail
Records were aggregated as large ﬁles by TS/SCI—cleared groups at
COMPANY A and COMPANY B and forwarded, on an hourly or daily
basis, across classified communications circuits to a PSP-restricted NSA
data repository.

COMPANY A provided PSP-authorized CDRs as early as November 2001,
and COMPANY B began to provide CDRs in February 2002. Both
continued to provide this support through the end of the PSP, and support
continues today under the FISC Business Records Order. COMPANY C
provided select PSP-authorized CDRs from December 2002 through March
2003.

(TS//SI-ECI//N F) Internet Metadata. The last category of private sector
assistance was access to Internet Protocol (IP) metadata associated with
communications of al Qaeda (and affiliates) from data links owned or
operated by COMPANIES A, B, and C. In order to be a candidate for PSP
IP metadata collection, data links were ﬁrst vetted to ensure that the
preponderance of communications was from foreign sources, and that there
was a high probability of collecting al Qaeda (and affiliate)
communications. NSA took great care to ensure that metadata was
produced against foreign, not domestic, communications.

(TS//SI-ECI//NF) COMPANY A began providing PSP IP metadata
collection as early as November 2001. Although COMPANY B began
providing CD-ROMs of PSP 1P metadata in October 2001, an automated
transfer of data was not available until February-March 2002. The
Presidential authority to collect IP metadata was terminated in March 2004.
COMPANY A and COMPANY B IP metadata collection resumed after the
FISC Pen Register/Trap & Trace (PR/TT) Order authorizing this activity
was signed on 15 July 2004. COMPANY C provided IP metadata
beginning in April 2005.
