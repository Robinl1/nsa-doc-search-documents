1. POLICY STATEMENT

1.1 Introduction

1.1.1 This policy deﬁnes the use of mobile phones by Tryst Travellers deployed
overseas. It has been agreed between OPA—TAS and PISECGIAS and is to
be read by all officers prior to deployment overseas.

1.1.2 It is OPA—TAS policy for officers to adopt best practice in the use of covert
mobile phones when deployed overseas in order to ensure both their own
personal security and GCHQ’s operational security. This policy dictates the
use of FCC provided non-attributable official and personal mobile phones by
ofﬁcers while on deployment.

2. Operating Rules

1.1.3 Ofﬁcial mobile phones are accountable items and must be signed for when
taken from the OPA—TAS secure store.

1.1.4 The mobile phones and the accessories must be returned to OPA—TAS on
return to the UK. Failure to do so may preclude future travel.

1.1.5 Official phones are to be used only for ofﬁcial business in country and
MUST not be used to make personal calls to the UK. If a call is unavoidable
then only out of area numbers can be called, these are:

0 GSOC TRYST OOA — 0207
o TAS TRYST OOA — 0207
1.1.6 To avoid compromise the following must be adhered to:

o The covert mobile phones are equipped with BLUETOOTH and therefore
they MUST not be switched on or used within a 50-mile radius of
Cheltenham and within this radius the battery must be removed from the

phone.

 

o The covert mobile phone MUST NOT be recharged at the officer’s home
address or at temporary residence e.g. a hotel room, if it is within the 50
miles radius. If a phone needs to be charged then it is acceptable to do
so either at the airport or at your destination.
