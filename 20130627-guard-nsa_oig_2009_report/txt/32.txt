(TS//SI//NF) Upon conﬁrmation that formal NSA letters requesting their
assistance were forthcoming, the providers, acting independently and
ofﬁcially unaware of the cooperating agreements with other companies,
initiated collection to support the PSP.

(TS//SI//NF) 2002: In early 2002, NSA SSO personnel met with the Senior
Vice President of Government Systems and other employees from
COMPANY E. Under the authority of the PSP, NSA asked COMPANY E
to provide call detail records (CDR) in support of security for the 2002
Olympics in Salt Lake City. On 11 February 2002, the company’s CEO
agreed to cooperate with NSA. On 19 February 2002, COMPANY E
submitted a written proposal that discussed methods it could use to
regularly replicate call record information stored in a COMPANY E facility
and potentially forward the same information to NSA. Discussions with
COMPANY E continued in 2003. However, the COMPANY B General
Counsel ultimately decided not to support NSA.

(TS//SI//NF) On 5 September 2002, NSA legal and operational personnel
met with internet provider COMPANY D’s General Counsel to discuss the
PSP and ask for the company’s support. COMPANY D provided support,
but it was minimal. (For a description of COMPANY D’s support, see
page _, “What Providers Furnished”).

(TS//SI//NF) On 29 October 2002, NSA legal and operational personnel
met with internet provider COMPANY F’s Legal and Corporate Affairs
personnel, and a former NSA OGC employee hired by COMPANY F as
independent counsel. NSA requested COMPANY F’s support under the
PSP for email content. At the meeting, COMPANY F requested a letter
from the Attorney General certifying the legality of the PSP. In December
2002, NSA’s Commercial Technologies Group was informed that the
company’s CEO agreed to support the PSP. According to NSA’s General
Counsel, COMPANY F did not participate in the PSP because of corporate
liability concerns.

(TS//SI//NF) 2003: In April 2003, NSA legal and operational personnel
met with the President and Chief Operating Officer, General Counsel, and
other personnel from private sector COMPANY G. After the meeting, the
company’s General Counsel wanted to seek the opinion of outside counsel.
NSA determined the risk associated with additional disclosure outweighed
what COMPANY G would have provided. NSA decided to not pursue a
partnership with this company.
