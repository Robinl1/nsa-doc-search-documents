through ﬁber—optic cables, gateway switches, and data networks. They also
provide foreign intelligence authorized under the FISA.

(TS//SI//NF) According to General Alexander, General Hayden’s
replacement as Director of NSA/CSS, if the relationships with these
companies were ever terminated, the U.S. SIGINT system would be
irrevocably damaged, because NSA would have sacriﬁced America’s home
ﬁeld advantage as the primary hub for worldwide telecommunications.

(U) Partnerships after 11 September 2001

(TS//SI//NF) According to the former Deputy Chief of SSO, between 11
September 2001 and the 4 October 2001 Authorization, COMPANY A and
COMPANY B contacted NSA and asked “what can we do to help?”
COMPANY B personnel approached NSA SSO personnel through an
existing program. They said they noticed odd patterns in domestic calling
records surrounding the events of 11 September and offered call records
and analysis. With no appropriate authority under which to accept the call
records, NSA suggested the company contact the FBI.

(U/IFOUO) Partnerships Supporting the PSP

 

(TS//SI//NF) Once the Authorization was signed on 4 October 2001, NSA
began a process of identifying and visiting commercial entities requesting
their support. While requesting help from corporate entities to support the
PSP, NSA personnel made it clear that the PSP was a cooperative program
and participation was voluntary. NSA knew that the PSP was an
extraordinary program and understood if companies viewed it as too much
ofa liability.

(TS//SI//NF) NSA Approaches to Private Sector Companies

(TS//SI//NF) 2001: On Columbus Day, 8 October 2001, NSA Special
Source Operations (SSO) personnel responsible for the access relationships
with corporate partners COMPANY A, COMPANY B, and COMPANY C
were called in to work and informed that the President had authorized the
PSP on 4 October 2001. The SSO personnel were tasked with initiating a
dialog with the respective TS/SCI—cleared officials from COMPANIES A,
B, and C to seek their cooperation under the new Authorization. Over the
next few business days, SSO personnel met separately with officials from
the three companies. Each company agreed to cooperate.
