would grant a warrant before initiating emergency surveillance.
Additionally, before NSA surveillance requests were submitted to the
Attorney General, they had to be reviewed by NSA intelligence ofﬁcers,
NSA attorneys, and Department of Justice attorneys. Each reviewer had to
be satisﬁed that standards had been met before the request proceeded to the
next review group, and each request was certiﬁed by a senior official in the

or people who attended General Hayden’s meetings with White House
representatives. General Hayden stated that after consulting with NSA
personnel, he described to the White House how NSA collection of
communications on a wire inside the United States was constrained by the
FISA statute. Speciﬁcally, NSA could not collect from a wire in the United
