WORKING DRAFT

(TS//SI//N F) Foreign selectors tasked for PSP content collection did not
require formal approvals or tasking packages. Analysts were responsible

for determining whether a foreign selector met the criteria for foreign
intelligence teﬁﬁs—ef-tl-‘reﬁrthei-ﬁtat—ien.

(TS//SI//N F) Collection. After a domestic selector was approved for PSP
content collection, it was identiﬁed as “tasked” in the STELLARWIND
Addresses Database by CT/AAD tasking managers who then emailed a
collection tasking request to the 880 Collection Manager for telephony
and Internet content collection. Foreign selector content collection
requests were sent directly to the 880 Collection Manager. They did not
require special approval.

 

(TS//SI//STLW//NF) SSO collection managers were responsible for
ensuring that telephony and Internet content selectors were put on or taken
off collection. For teleplieny-teleghonv content selectors. collection
managers sent content collection tasking instructions to private sector
companies. Private sector companies were responsible for implementing
tasking at front-end devices to obtain the required content collection. For
Internet content selectors. collection managers sent content tasking
instructions directly to equipment installed at

company-controlled locations. Collected data was sent back to NSA/SSO
and made available to analysts through the HYBRID voice processing
system for telephony content selectors or the PINWALE database for
Internet content selectors. SSO collection managers worked with private
sector companies and the CT Product Line to ensure that collected data was
as intended and legally authorized.

 

 

 

 

 

(TS//SI//N F) Storage. Content (voice or dBata) collected under PSP was
stored in protected partitions in existing NSA databases. Access to the
partitions was restricted to PSP-cleared personnel.

(TS//SI//N F) Reporting. After analyzing content data collected under
Presidential authority and identifying foreign intelligence information,
counterterrorism analysts wrote reports. After an initial review within the
CT Product Line, some reports were sent to SID Oversight and Compliance
(0&C) for a second review for U.S. person identities. 0&C reviewers
determined whether the U.S. identities in the report were necessary to
assess or understand the foreign intelligence information being reported Q;
was required within the conduct of recipients ofﬁcial duties . If an identity
was found to be unnecessary, it was not reported. Before any U.S. person
information was disseminated in reporting, internal NSA approvals were
obtained as required by United States Signals Intelligence Directive
SP0018 — Legal Compliance and Minimization Procedures.
