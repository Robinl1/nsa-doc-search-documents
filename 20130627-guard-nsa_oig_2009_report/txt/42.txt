May 2004 opinion states that NSA collection of telephony metadata as
business records under the Authorization was legally supportable, the
provider preferred to be compelled to do so by a court order.”

(TS//SI//NF) As with the PR/TT Order, Do] and NSA collaboratively
designed the application, prepared declarations, and responded to questions
from court advisers. Their previous experience in drafting the PRTT Order
made this process more efficient.

(TS//SI//NF) The FISC signed the ﬁrst Business Records Order on 24 May
2006. The order essentially gave NSA the same authority to collect bulk
telephony metadata from business records that it had under the PSP. And,
unlike the PRTT, there was no break in collection at transition. The order
did, however, limit the number of people that could access the data and
required more stringent oversight by and reporting to DOJ. The FISC
continues to renew the Business Records Order every 90 days or so. (See
Appendix H.)

(TS//SI//NF) Transition of Internet and Telephony Content Collection to the
Foreign and Domestic Content Orders

(TS//SI//N F) According to NSA OGC, the transition of PSP content
collection to FISC orders was driven by Do]. Do] had contemplated a
transition in July 2004 when the FISC’s signing of the PR/TT order
indicated its willingness to authorize PSP activities under court order.
Given this precedent, DoJ concluded the FISC might also accept content
collection. However, little progress was made until June 2005 when the
Do] OIPR with NSA OGC and SID representatives began researching the
feasibility of collecting PSP content under court order. In essence, DOJ
and NSA needed to ﬁnd a legal the01y that would allow NSA to add and
drop thousands of foreign targets for content collection. Because the law
was more restrictive for content than metadata, NSA had serious
reservations about whether it would be possible to ﬁnd a workable solution
using a FISC order at that time, especially given the large number of
selectors to be tasked and the complexity from legal and operational
perspectives. For example:

”(TS//STLVW/SI//OR/NF) In addition to the telephony metdata that NSA was receiving from private sector
companies as business records, it was also obtaining “live” telephony metadata from its own SIGINT
collection sources. It continued until mid-2005. (***We will include a reference to the corresponding
