(U) TWO: IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AUTHORITY AND
RESULTING SIGINT PRODUCT

(TS//Sl//NF) General Hayden said that although he felt comfortable
exercising the Presidential authorization and believed it to be legal, he
recognized that it was politically sensitive and controversial and would be
subjected to scrutiny at some point in time. He and NSA leadership strove
to ensure that NSA personnel executed the terms of the Authorization with
care and diligence and that they not go beyond that which was authorized.
PSP—related operations began on 6 October. Early on, personnel worked
unden the assumption that the Authorization was temporary and that
operations would stop in the near future. Aften it became evident that the
Authority would be continuously renewed, management focused on
designing processes and procedures fon Program activity.
