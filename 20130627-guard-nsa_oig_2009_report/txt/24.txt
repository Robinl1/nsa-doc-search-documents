understanding that the opinion was not shared with NSA because it was
considered conﬁdential legal advice to the President.

(TS//SI//NF) The IG, GC, and Deputy GC agreed that their inability to read
the OLC opinion did not prevent or impair them from executing and
overseeing the Program. They were able to determine legality of the
Program independently from Do] (see Appendix D). However, the IG said
that he found the secrecy surrounding the legal rationale to be “odd.”
Speciﬁcally, he said that it was “strange that NSA was told to execute a

few others, including three OGC attorneys, Program Managers, and certain
operational personnel. Those with access were not allowed to disseminate

the Authorizations.

(TS//SI//NF) Importantly, most NSA operations personnel, including the
Chief of the CT Product Line, who approved tasking for content collection,
were not allowed to see the actual authorization. Rather, OGC answered

“on call” basis for operators. When the Authorization changed, OGC
