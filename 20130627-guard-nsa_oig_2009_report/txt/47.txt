WORKING DRAFT

 

(U) NSA [6 Not Cleared until ‘2002

(TS//Sl//NF) We could not determine exact reasons for
why the NSA [G was not cleared for the PSP until
August 2002. According to the NSA General Counsel,
the President would not allow the [G to be briefed
soonen General Hayden did not specifically recall why
the [G was not brought in earlier, but thought that it
had not been appropriate to do so when it was
uncertain how long the Program would last and before
operations had stabilized. The NSA lG pointed out
that he did not take the IG position until April 2002, so
NSA leadership or the White House may have been
resistant to clearing eithen a new on an acting lG.

(TS//Sl//NF) Regardless, by August 2002, General
Hayden and the NSA General Counsel wanted to
institutionalize oversight of the Program by bringing in
the [G General Hayden recalled having to “make a
case” to the White House to clean the [G at that time.

 

 

(U//FOU.O) OIG concerns lead to change

(C) In addition to formal recommendations made in review and
investigative reports, OIG concerns about access to the terms of the
Presidential authorization and about the means of reporting PSP violations
resulted in three major changes.

(C) First, in December 2002, the IG recommended that General Hayden
formally delegate authority to NSA operational personnel, some of whom
had unknowingly violated terms of the Authorization. The Counsel to the
Vice President, demanding secrecy, refused to let them see terms of the
authority, which had been delegated by the President to the Secretary of
Defense, who delegated it to the Director of NSA. General Hayden issued
the first “Delegation of Authority” letter to key operational personnel in the
SID on 4 March 2003. Subsequent delegation letters were issued each time
the President renewed the authority.
