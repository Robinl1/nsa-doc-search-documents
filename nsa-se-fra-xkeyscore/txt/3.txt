KEY TAKEAWAYS:
(SHREL USA, SWE) Recommend General Alexander and DIDIR emphasize the following
points:

Quantum Operations:

0 (TSHSIHREL TO USA, SWE) Acknowledge the success that NSA, FRA, and GCHQ
have had on WINTERLIGHT. Last month, we received a message from our Swedish
partner that GCHQ received F RA QUANTUM tips that led to 100 shots, five of which
were successfully redirected to the GCHQ server. The Foreign Affairs Directorate (FAD)
conﬁrmed with Tailored Access Operations (TAO) that this validates the "proof of
concept" that was originally trying to be accomplished. Additionally, FAD, TAO, and
Enterprise Information Technology Services are still working through the technical
solution to have FRA tip directly to NSA. S3 Data Acquisitions’ goal is to have a
solution for a direct tip to FRA operational by this summer. The Quantum effort
motivated the recent XKEYSCORE installatiOn. FRA is currently evaluating it for use to
support their SIGINT Deve10pment work.

Cable Accessi’Reporting and Analysis:

0 (TSHSIHREL TO USA, SWE) Highlight that NSAICSS would like to continue to
collaborate on FRA’s cable access program, which has resulted in unique SIGINT
reporting on a variety of high-priority SIGINT topics (123 reports thus far this fiscal
year). FRA continues to gain access to more data from additional telecommunications
companies, making the cable access potentially lucrative for NSAJ’CSS for targets beyond
Russia.
