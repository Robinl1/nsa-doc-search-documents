(TS/48W) (HMC Character): In Module 1, we mentioned that in order to gain comprehensive insight into a target’s activities, it is often necessary to
Ieverage multiple authorities and tools. CT targets have maintained an ongoing desire to conduct attacks within the United States. Given the unique U.S.-
focus ofthe BR and PR/TT Programs, NSA is able to ﬁll collection gaps left by our other authorities.

(IS/48W) To illustrate how these various authorities can complement each other to ﬁll critical gaps, as well as to show how BR and PR/TT ﬁt into the
analytic workﬂow, we’ll step through the example of Najibullah Zazi and the New York subway plot.
