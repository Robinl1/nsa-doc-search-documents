TAO implants have collection parameters that are put
on exfil received thru TAO backend
— case notation, SIGAD, PDDG, classification/legal authority

The passive collector has another set of these:

— Site has a SIGAD, collector has a PDDG, the link it sees the
traffic on has a case notation, and the access has a
classification floor/legal authority

Current backend repositories and presenters weren’t
designed to expect TWO of these!!!

Which gets put on the data??? And where?

And (drum roll) how do we solve this problem
CONSISTENTLY across the enterprise?
