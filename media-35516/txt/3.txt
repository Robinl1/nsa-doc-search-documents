- Link layer: BRAVENICKEL project (optical Muxes)

Copied link is not disguised, just routed on an unused layer
2 path that a passive collector can monitor

Selection happens in the passive collector

° Network layer: APEX for HAMMERMILL (routers)

Router is tasked to select and exfil targeted traffic (perhaps
all of a particular protocol)

Exfil is disguised (“munged", encrypted) to avoid detection

Passive collector looks for IP source/destination address in
order to detect the traffic

If further selection/processing is to be done in collector, the
exfil must be “unwrapped” (unmunged, decrypted)

EXfiI can be directed to passive or to TAO by changing the
destination address
