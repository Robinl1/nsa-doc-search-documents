- Working definition: Active implant copies traffic and

directs a copy past a passive collector
— Issues arise when collector is also processing passive traffic
simultaneously

- Current: Implants on network infrastructure devices,
not user endpoints

- Two types:
— Physical/link layer:

- an implant copies and shapes an entire link (E1, STMl) without
selection; passive midpoint does selection

— Network layer:

- an implant performs targeted copying based on IP or
application parameters and exfils only the targeted traffic;
passive collector may or may not do further selection.
