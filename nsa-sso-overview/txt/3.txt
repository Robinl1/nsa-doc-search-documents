[edit] (U) Yahoo Webmessenger
(U) Reason for Optimizing

(S//SI//REL USA, FVEY) Yahoo's web-based Messenger client sends
frequent requests, and receives frequent responses, for inbox and buddy
status which are highly repetitive and contain little or no useful FI
information in the actual message content beyond the simple fact that the
user was online. During the first two weeks of December, at least eight
selectors were detasked by CSRC due to excessive collection (exceeding
session limits).
