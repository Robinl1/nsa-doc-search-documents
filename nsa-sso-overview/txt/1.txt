[edit] (U) SSO Collection Optimization Overview

(S//SI//REL USA, FVEY) This wiki article collects and documents the
activities within SSO to optimize collection from SSO sites. It is a direct
result of the activities and findings from the Large Access Exploitation
(LAE) Working Group. Optimization activities can be categorized as:
impacting primarily content collection, i.e., feeding repositories like
PINWALE and PRESSUREWAVE; metadata, perhaps better termed
"structured data," collection, i.e., primarily feeding repositories like
MARINA or MAINWAY; or both.

(TS/lSI/IREL USA, FVEY) An examination into the content collected by
SSO sites in the fall of 2011 revealed that a significant portion of collection
was repetitive, better placed into metadata repositories, or of little foreign
intelligence value. Rapidly changing internet protocols, imprecise targeting
methods, and constantly shifting target technology use means that selectors
or traffic seen by tasking today may not be the same tomorrow. In addition,
several emerging technologies in use by targets or contacts of targets have
protocols which can cause gross over-collection and selector detasking, e.g.,
Yahoo! Webmessenger, which cannot be prevented under UTT tasking, as
the protocol contains the precise selector tasked.

(TS/lSI/IREL USA, FVEY) The SSO Optimization team's job is to identify
these types of data, and ensure appropriate corrective action is taken,
throttling the data from corporate content or metadata repositories, as
appropriate.

(TS/lSI/IREL USA, FVEY) Implementation details for specific SSO sites
can be found on the SSO Collection Optimization NOFORN wiki page.
