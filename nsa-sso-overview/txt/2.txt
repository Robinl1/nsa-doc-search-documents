[edit] (U) Address Books
(U) Reason for Optimizing

(TS//SI//REL USA, FVEY) Ownerless address books can account for 22%
2012), are highly repetitive, and can be both numerous and large.
Additionally, the data is highly structured, so they are better parsed and
analyzed in structured repositories like MARINA.

(U) Criteria (SCISSORS)

(TS//SI//REL USA, FVEY) To alleviate the large number of ownerless
address books currently being collected, address books will be blocked at
SCISSORS. SCISSORS will process each ﬂow and label sessions with the
category of 8223 where they meet the following criteria:

0 (Yahoo|Gmail|Hotmail)-viewAddressBook (which represents ~90% of all
addressbook collection)

0 APMSGTYPE IS PRESENT

0 NO APACTIVEUSER

° SIGAD = Given SIGADS (currently, four)

(TS//SI//REL USA, FVEY) The sessions that do not meet the above criteria
will send metadata to FALLOUT, but the sessions will be dropped before
reaching PINWALE. Metrics for category 8223 will not be available in
YELLOWSTONE, and these volumes will not count against PINWALE site
caps set by the CSRC.

(U) Criteria (XKEYSCORE)

(TS//SI//REL USA, FVEY) Because of how inefficient the SCISSORS
implementation of ownerless address book throttles is (essentially requiring
that SCISSORS process all of the selected content from the affected
dataﬂows twice), work is underway to implement the same throttle in
XKEYSCORE at site. This requires a software modification to allow certain
types of ownerless buddy list metadata to be created at site (vs at
SCISSORS, under the current architecture). Then a deployed XKEYSCORE
fingerprint will block the content while allowing the metadata to be
memorialized.
