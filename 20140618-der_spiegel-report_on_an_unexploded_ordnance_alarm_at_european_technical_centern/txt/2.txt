 

[UHFDUCJ] During World War II the site on which the European Technical Center
[ETC] is located [in Main: Kastel. Germany} served as a tank repair depot. Not too
surprisingly. the station was a key target ofAllied bombing. On December 2|]. 2Uﬂ5.
during suryey actiyities ofthe area for installation ofan underground ﬁber optic
line. metallic anomalies were discoyered and these were suspected of being
unexploded ordnance, since such items had been discoyered 'preyiously.

[UHFDUCJ] Dperating with the following guiding principles. ETC and NSAW
personnel began contingency planning to ensure that critical ETC functions would
continue in the eyent of an explosion.

I To protect human life.

I To protect business eguities in a prudent manner.

I To keep as much ofthe business running as possible. and

I To 'put in place contingency measures for personnel. cryptologic eguipment.
and communication links.

[UHFDUD] By 12 January 2006. it had been determined that the risk of an
uncontrolled explosion was .low and that the distance from the closest anomaly to
ETC buildings was outside the restricted zone as reguired by German law.
Howeyer. to ensure safety. the entire base was to be closed to all personnel on
24 and 25 January. Based on brieﬁngs 'proyided by ETC to the Proyost Marshall.
ETC was 'permitted to man the Network Communication Center with two critical
staffmembers.

[SHED ETC and NSAW personnel worked to mitigate the risk by setting up an
alternate communications facility at Main: Finthen. Unfortunately only six of the
circuits passing through ETC from the Top 100' Circuits list could be accommodated
by the alternate link and none of those was a. foreign partner link. [All were directly
supporting efforts in Irag and Afghanistan.) A message was sent to the appropriate
SLCJs [SICINT Liaison Ofﬁcers} to notify the partners ofthe potential impact. but
also to assure them that the chance of'disruption was small.

[C] Excayation was initiated on 24January. The four anomalies were dug up and no
ordnance was found. Three ofthe four holes contained miscellaneous metallic
debris and the fourth contained I-beams that supported an underground storage
area. or tunnel in the original “WWII facility. The base was to be reopened for normal
trafﬁc at 1800' local time and normal ETC operations were resumed on 25
January.
