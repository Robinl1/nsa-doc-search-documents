By—011201 1-10-12 0850

(T S//SI//N F) The FISA Court signed the 2011 FAA Certiﬁcations on 3 Oct 2011 — these
are valid until 2 Oct 2012, permitting SSO FAA-authorized accesses to continue
operations. However, in the 80-page opinion, the judge ordered certain “upstream” or
“passive” FAA DNI collection to cease after 30 days, unless NSA implements solutions
to correct all deﬁciencies identiﬁed in the opinion document. PRISM operations are not
affected by these caveats. All PRISM providers, except Yahoo and Google, were
successfully transitioned to the new Certiﬁcations. We expect Yahoo and Google to
complete transitioning by Friday 6 Oct. Regarding the non—PRISM FAA collection
programs, the Court. cited targeting and minimization procedures related to collection of
Multiple Communications Transactions as “deﬁcient on statutory and constitutional
gromids.” 880, Technology Directorate, OGC, and other organizations are coordinating a
response, which includes planning to implement a conservative solution in which the
higher-risk collection will be sequestered. It is possible that this higher risk collection
contains much of the non-duplicative FAA collection resulting in FAA reporting from
upstream accesses. This solution is designed to comply with the judge’s order; however,
the judge will have to determine if it does. If the solution is installed, $80 will then work
with OPIs and OGC to modify the solution over time such that the ﬁltering process will
be optimized to permit more valid collection to be processed and forwarded to OPIs.
Finally, in parallel with these efforts, the OGC is contemplating ﬁling an appeal to the
ruling.
