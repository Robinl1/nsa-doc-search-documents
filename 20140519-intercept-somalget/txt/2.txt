(U) Notes:

1. (U) Target development = the process by which an analyst can extend his/her
knowledge of a known target by observing elements of metadata that relate to that
target.

2. (U) Target discovery = the process whereby an analyst can discover targets by
observing metadata as it relates to behaviors characteristic of his/her target set,
regardless of whether or not the newly discovered selectors are related to known
targets.

3. (S/lSIl/REL) The nominal "30 days storage" actually varies depending upon on
space, power, and observed activity levels.

4. (TS/ISU/REL) Observing that targets tend to use prepaid calling cards in an attempt
to mask the destination of telephone calls, 82F focused on mobile identifiers in number
ranges that represent newly activated accounts. We have also used SMS text messages
to identify and retrieve audio of interest.

5. (S/lSIl/REL) Storage capacity is directly related to the amount of disk storage that
can be deployed. When deployed against entire networks, as SOMALGET is, the back-
end database and processing required for interactive search and retrieval of cuts also
requires enterprise-class data warehousing and high-performance processing to manage
the vast amount of data captured. Currently this warehouse dynamically manages
roughly 5 billion call events, with the capacity to expand well beyond our current target
communications. This retrospective retrieval infrastructure is web based and is already
in place. As noted, with proper engineering and coordination, there is little reason this
capability cannot expand to other accesses, provided compatible hardware and
interfaces are developed and deployed.
