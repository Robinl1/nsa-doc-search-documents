FLYING PIG implementation

- Federated QFD approach

ova-T Rwrﬁiﬂmo

Multiple separate cloud analytics, each of which produce a QFD (Query
Focussed Dataset).

Analytics are run once a week, on approximately 20 billion events.

A single query in the web interface results in calls to multiple QFDs,
which are returned to the user in separate panels.

Results in:

(a) fast queries,

(b) easy-to-maintain modular code, and importantly
(0) easy to add future TLSISSL QFDs.
