Other HUSH PUPPY datasets

HUSH PUPPY also makes use of Yahoo T-cookies to do correlations
A T-cookie contains the IP address of the client as Yahoo sees it

Hence a T cookie coming from a private IP can give the public IP of the
NAT or proxy

In addition, HUSH PUPPY uses the following data to help verify results

- Kerberos & Lotus Notes: Domains, organisations, departments, countries,
machine names, user names

- HTTP: Heuristic detection of Intranet web servers
- SSL: Issuers, subjects, countries
- SMTP: From & to domains
