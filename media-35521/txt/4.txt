TOP SECRET/ISIIIREL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL

Motivations for FLYING PIG

— More and more services used by GCHQ targets are moving to TLSISSL to
increase user confidence, e.g. Hotmail, Yahoo, Gmail, etc.

— Terrorists and cyber criminals are common users of TLSISSL to hide their
comms (not necessarily using the big providers).

— A TLSISSL knowledge base could provide a means to extract as much
information from the unencrypted traffic as possible.
