HUSH PUPPY — motivation

Much private network traffic seen but previously discarded
If traffic could be attributed, potential high value — close access
HUSH PUPPY is a bulk private network identification Cloud analytic

Basic idea is to look for the same TDI being seen coming from a
private address and then from a public address within a short time

The private traffic can then be attributed to the owner of the public
address

Works for SSE 8:. COMSAT
