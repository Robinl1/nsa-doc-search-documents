TOP SECRET/ISIIIREL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL

Identification of malicious TLSISSL

° Can identify malicious TLSISSL using signatures if known

- However this approach generally does not allow discovery of new threats

- Alternative is to use “behavioural” features to automatically identify potentially
malicious traffic

- Features currently being investigated include:

— Certificates with same subject but different issuers — may be indicative of
Diginotar—style attack

— Beaconing in TLSISSL (indicative of botnetsIFlS implants)
— Number of client cipher suites offered

— Repeated identical random challenges
