(S//S|//REL) Analyst inputs areas of interest and time range. The analytic returns an excel file with a list
of IMSls seen in those areas at that time. It is enriched with OCTAVE tasking information. Limitations are
that tower locations in OCTSKYWARD can be imprecise. Also, the SEDB Tower QFD summarizes IMSIs by
LAIC by day. Summaries by MSISDN or IMEI are not available.

(TMAC) DNI Co-Travel Analytic
Café Spin 1 (October 2011 — January 2012)

Background

(TS//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY) The Café project involved TMAC, SSG, T1212, and SZ|5 working in concert to
develop both DNI and DNR cloud—based travel analytics. The absence of a cloud—based solution that
could run over bulk data motivated this initiative. The Café objective was to steer cloud travel analytics
toward operational use and ultimately merge the DNI and DNR analytics in a unified co—travel analytic.
These analytics are currently still under development,- however, they are available to the development
community on GM—PLACE.

(TS//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY) This analytic uses |P geolocation of active user/presence events as travel
indication.

(TS//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY) The DNI analytic operates in one of two modes. The first mode accepts a list
of tasked targets via UTT, and attempts to identify co—travelers for those targets that have been deemed
to have travelled during a specified time window (typically 30 days). The analytic only considers targets
that traveled between at least 2 countries in a given month. For these traveling targets, candidate co—
travelers are scored based on how many times they were seen in the same locations during the same
times as the target. Target locations are given by DNI selector |P geolocation, provided by ASDF enriched
