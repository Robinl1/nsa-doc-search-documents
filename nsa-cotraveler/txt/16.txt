Background

(TS//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY) The Café project involved TMAC, SSG, T1212, and $2|5 working in concert to
develop both DNI and DNR cloud—based travel analytics. The absence of a cloud—based solution that
could run over bulk data motivated this initiative. The Café objective was to merge the DNI and DNR
analytics to create one complete co—travel analytic,- however the DNR co—traveler analytic, described
below, is currently still under development.

(TS//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY) The DNR cloud—based analytic considers all known targets (tasked in OCTAVE)
that have traveled within a given date range (e.g., monthly roll—up to five month range), and attempts to
find their co—travelers. Co—travelers are defined as individuals that were seen in the same area (currently
defined by VLRs) around the same time as the targets. The output includes both tasked and untasked
selectors as possible co—travelers with the tasked seeds. Each possible co—traveler is assigned a score
that indicates the probability of co—travel with the seed. Higher scores are assigned to co—travelers that
are seen at more ofthe same locations and closer in time (pairs are given one point if seen within one

hour, and a half point if seen within two hours of each other).

 

Status and Summary
Status Source Data Caveats
Analytic has been tested on — FASCIA data on GM—PLACE — Analytic only considers tasked
FASCIA data on GM-PLACE — ”403 rows in the GM PLACE selectors as seeds

CLOUDBASE table — Source data provided by VLRs
Command line interface — CHALKFUN Enrichment (VLR — Co—travel events are rolled—up
available to developers Country mapping) by the hour

— CLOUDBASE Events (lMSl,|ME|)
rounded to nearest hour

 

Future Work

(S//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY) Follow—on analysis could take advantage of FASTSCOPE reservation number
feature which will return all co—travelers that travel on the same reservation number within a given time
period (because reservation numbers are reused, a specific timeframe must be provided).
