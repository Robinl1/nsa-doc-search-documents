Scalable Analytics Tradecraft Center (SATC) Geospatial Lifelines Co-
Travel QFD
—

Background

(TS//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY) The geospatial lifelines QFD applies the concept of ”dwell times” to identify
DNR co—travelers. Dwell times describe the time period spent at the beginning or ending destination. A
location is considered a beginning or ending location if the dwell time at that location is greater than 2
hours.

(TS//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY) This QFD first generates geohashes using GSM event data, and then
calculates transition lines indicating that a device traveled from one geohash to another. The result is a
graph in which the geohashes represent nodes and the transitions represent links or edges. Clustering
algorithms are applied to the graphs to determine locations and selectors of interest.

(TS//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY) The geospatial lifelines represent the beginning and ending locations, as
defined by their dwe|| times, and all other intermediate observations. The likeliness of co—travel along
paths between starting and destination points is based on the following measurements: net distance,

time oftransition (mins), speed (kph), Azimuth, and number of travel segments.

Future Work

(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) The code for this QFD is available through SATC, but the analytic is no longer
under development. Ideas for future work before the project ended included adding acceleration and
sinuosity to the computation.

Background

(S//S|//REL) The Common IMSIs Analytic is a model in SEDB JEMA finds SIM card activity seen on cell
tower panels in multiple areas (e.g.— border crossings commonly used by traffickers). It makes use ofthe
