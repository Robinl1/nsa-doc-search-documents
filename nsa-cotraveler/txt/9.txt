- Co-Traveler Analytics
—

Background

(TS//S|/RELTO USA, FVEY)- has developed two co—travel analytics: Fast Follower (FF) and
Meet&Greet Spatial Chaining (MGSC). The FF analytic was initially designed to detect individuals who
are following station personnel. Detailed non—SIGINT path data is collected consensually on the station
personnel, and this reference path data provides the seeds for this analytic, which attempts to discover
mobile GEO data indicating individuals that may be following the station personnel. The MGSC analytic
is designed to detect meetings between high—value individuals and other entities.

(TS//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY) The FF analytic begins by considering non—SIGINT reference paths for station
personnel based on detailed knowledge of the entity’s location. Candidate followers are determined by
identifying other individuals that have traversed some number of consecutive points (determined by the
analyst) that match the reference path in space and time. The analyst also sets a parameter to specify
the minimum distance that must be covered along a candidate path.

(S//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY) The MGSC analytic is designed for ELKPRINTS data from smartphones. This
analytic identifies sequences of consecutive location points close in time and combines them into a
single data point. A maximum velocity movement parameter is applied to create a time window around
each point representing the approximate time at which the individual was located there (as opposed to
traveling to or from that location). Finally, co—travelers are identified by discovering pairs of selectors
that meet the duration and distance thresholds set by the analyst as input parameters. Spatial chaining
software aggregates and presents the meeting data, including the locations, times, and scoring metrics
to the analyst.
