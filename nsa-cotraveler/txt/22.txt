Name of Analytic

(not effective for large queries
across multiple countries and
large time frames)

 

RT-RG Sidekicks

(TS//S|/REL TO USA, FVEY).
This analytic computes
”movement summaries” of
tasked selectors. These are
lists of locations that a target
Visited during the timeframe
of interest. Then, the system
discovers pairs of targets that
could be traveling together by
comparing their movement
summaries, factoring out pairs
that could not have
reasonably arrived at the
meeting waypoints within 10
minutes of each other.
Because this analytic
considers physical (LAT/LONG)
locations and travel velocities,
it can provide co—traveler
results that include selectors
on different provider
networks.

— Currently
running on RT—
RG—
— Could possibly
scale to FASCIA
event
summaries

Cloud—based

— QFD available at
RT—RG analyst
desktop.

— RT—RG Tools:
Goldminer, CHET,
GEOT

— Requires pre—computing all
selectors against all selectors,
which can be expensive

— Current output includes only
tasked selectors

— Analytic is not designed for
stationary targets

 

 

Scalable Analytics
Tradecraft Center
(SATC) Geospatial
Lifelines Co-
Travel QFD

 

This QFD first generates
geohashes using GSM event
data, and then calculates
transition lines indicating that
a device traveled from one
geohash to another.

The likeliness of co—travel is
based on dwell times at travel

 

— Geohashes of
GSM event data
retrieved from
FASCIA.

 

 

Analytic tested on
90 days of GSM
event data from
Code is available

through SATC, but
analytic is no

 

— Analytic designed for GSM
data, but could be applied to
other types of data

— Oriented to targets that
remain in one location for at
least 2 hours

— Requires Geocoded source
data for generating
