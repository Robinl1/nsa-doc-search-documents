Year 2012 (1 January — 31 March 2012) — EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
TO: SIGINT Director

 

I. (U) Overview

(U/lFOUO) The attached NSAW SID Intelligence Oversight (IO) Quarterly Report for the First Quarter
Calendar Year 2012 (1 January — 31 March 2012) identifies NSAW SID compliance with ED. 12333, DoD
Regulation 5240.1-R, NSA/CSS Policy 1-23, USSID SP0018, and all related policies and regulations.

(U/lFOUO) Detailed incident narratives are provided in the attached annexes. The number of incidents in
each category and a reference to the annex related to each incident category are contained in the body of the
report.

(U/lFOUO) As part of SID Oversight and Compliance’s (SV) charge to provide comprehensive trends and
analysis information as it pertains to incidents of non-compliance, this Executive Summary provides analysis
and evaluation of incidents reported throughout the current quarter to better address the “whys” and “hows”
behind NSAW SID’s compliance posture.

(U/lFOUO) Section II, Metrics, has been broken down into several sub-sections: metrics and analysis of
NSAW SID-reported incidents by authority, type, root cause, and organization. Also included is an assessment
of how incidents were discovered (i.e., methods of discovery) for SID-reported incidents (see Figure 7).

(U/lFOUO) Signiﬁcant Incidents of Non-compliance and Report Content follow in Sections III and IV,
respectively.

(SI/REL) Overall, the number of incidents reported during 1QCY12 increased by 11% as compared to the
number of incidents reported during 4QCY11. This included a rise in the number of ED. 12333 incidents, as
well as for incidents across all FISA authorities. The majority of incidents in all authorities were database
query incidents due to human error. Of note, S2 continued to be the NSAW SID organization with the largest
number of reported incidents (89%), although S2 experienced an overall decrease in reported incidents. SV
noted an overall improvement in timeliness regarding 1QCY12 IO Quarterly Report submissions from the SID
elements.
