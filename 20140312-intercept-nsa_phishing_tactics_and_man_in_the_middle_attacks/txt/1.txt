FOXACID these days...

XSS is becoming less and less viable with each passing day. It’s just
too hard to develop and too easy to circumvent. Because of this (and
other technical/OPSEC issues), the bulk spam mission is becoming
less and less viable as well.

The new exploit hotness is Quantum. Certain Quantum missions have
a success rate as high as 80%, where spam is less than 1%.

So, as spam and in-line XSS slowly fade away, the new eXploit
development push is for those utilizing MitM or MotS capabilities, as
well as many other very unique techniques.

Bottom line — if we can get the target to visit us in some sort of web
browser, we can probably own them. The only limitation is the “how”.
