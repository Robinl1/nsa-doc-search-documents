SECONDDATE

° SECONDDATE is an exploitation technique that takes advantage of
web-based protocols and man-in-the-rniddle (MitM) positioning.

0 SECONDDATE inﬂuences real-time communications between client
and server and can quietly redirect web-browsers to FA servers for
individual client exploitation.

- This allows mass exploitation potential for clients passing through
network choke points, but is configurable to provide surgical target
selection as well.
