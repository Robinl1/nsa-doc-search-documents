The Supreme Court has held that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in
telephone numbers dialed because a caller must convey the numbers to the telephone company to
complete the call. See Smith v. Maryland, 442 US. 735, 743—44 (1979). 111 Smith, the Court
concluded that the installation ofa pen register was not a “search” within the meaning of the
Fourth Amendment, and thus that no warrant was required to collect such information. Id. at
745-46. This conclusion followed from the Court’s previous holding in US. v. Miller, 425 US.
435 (1976), that an individual has no Fourth Amendment privacy interest in information released
to a third party andl ater coriveyed by that third party to a governmental entity Id. at 440
Accordingly, it is well settled that there is no reasonable expectation ofprivacy in the telephony
metadata the NSA proposes to analyze.6 (SI/SI)

Likewise, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in electronic communications
metadata. For Fourth Amendment purposes, courts have considered e-mails .to be analogous to
telephone calls and to letters sent through the postal system. See US. v. Charbonneau, 979 F.
Supp 1177, 1184 (SD. Ohio 1997); US. v. Maxwell, 45 M.J. 406,417 (C.A.A.F. 1996).
Following the same approach as Smith, courts have consistently held that the Fourth Amendment
is not implicated when the Government gathers information that appears on mail covers,
including the name and address of the addressee and of the sender, the postmark, and the class of
mail. See US. v. ChOate, 576 F.2d 165, 174 (9th Cir. 1978); US. v. DePoZz‘, 628 F ;2d 779 (2nd
Cir. 1980); US. v. Huie, 593 F.2d 14 (5th Cir. 1979)(per curiam). See also Vreeken v. Davis,
718 F.2d 343, 34748 (10th Cir. 1983) (concluding that a mail cover, whichrecords information
about the sender and recipient ofa letter, is “indistinguishable in any important reSpect from the
pen register at issue in Smith”). And courts have consistently found that individuals do not have
a reasonable expectation of privacy in information pertaining to the use of electronic media that

 

5 It is important to note that this memorandum addresses only those types of metadata
speciﬁcally identiﬁed in the Supplemental Procedures. As described above, NSA is required to
report regularly to the Department on new types of information that it is treating as “metadata ”
IfNSA does so, we will evaluate whether such new information also falls outside the Fourth
Amendment. (S//SI) '

6 Smith continues to be cited by the Supreme Court and lower courts for the proposition
that acquisition of telephone numbers does not implicate the Fourth Amendment. See, e.g., Kyllo
v. United States, 533 US. 27, 33 (2001); US. Telecom Commission v. FCC, 227 F.3d 450, 454
(DC. Cir. 2000). (U)
