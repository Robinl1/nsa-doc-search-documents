(h) (Sﬁ‘SB-Use of direction ﬁnding solely to determine the location of a
transmitter does not constitute electronic surveillance or collection even if directed at
transmitters believed to be used by United States persons. Unless collection of the
communications is otherwise authorized pursuant to this annex, the contents of communications
to which a United States person is a party monitored in the course of direction ﬁnding shall be
used solely to identify the transmitter.

2. Retention (U)

-(-S#S'B'Foreign communications of, or concerning, United States persons that are
intercepted by the United States Signals Intelligence System may be retained in their original
form or as transcribed only:

(a) if processed so as to eliminate any reference to United States persons;

(b) if necessary to the maintenance of technical data bases. Retention for this
purpose is permitted for a period sufﬁcient to allow a thorough exploitation and to permit access
to data that are, or are reasonably believed likely to become, relevant to a current or future
intelligent requirement. Sufﬁcient duration may vary with the nature of the exploitation. In the
context of a cryptanalytic effort, sufﬁcient duration may consist of a period of time during which
encrypted material is subject to, or of use in, cryptanalysis. In the case of international
commercial communications that may contain the identity of United States persons and that are
not enciphered or otherwise thought to contain secret meaning, sufﬁcient duration is one year
unless the Deputy Director for Operations, National Security Agency, determines in writing that
retention for a longer period is required to respond to authorized foreign intelligence or
counterintelligence requirements; or

(c) if dissemination of such communications without elimination of references to
such United States persons would be permitted under section 4.A.4 below.

3. Processing (U)

(a) (Saé‘SB-Foreign communications of, or concerning, United States persons must
be processed in accordanCe with the following limitations:

(1) When a selection term is intended to intercept a communication on the
basis of encipherment or some other aspect of the content of the communication, rather than the
identity of a communicant or the fact that the communication mentions a particular individual:

(a) No selection term may be used that is based on content and that is
reasonably likely to result in the interception of communications to or from a United States
person, or which has in the past resulted in the interception of a signiﬁcant number of such
