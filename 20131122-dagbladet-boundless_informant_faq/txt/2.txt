trends. In order to bin the records into a country, a normalized phone number (DNR) or an administrative region atom (DNI)
must be populated within the record. Clicking on a site (within the Site Speciﬁc view) will show the viewshed for that site —
what countries the site collects against.

(U//FOUO) Org View — The Organization View is designed to allow users to view the metadata record counts by
organizational structure (i.e. GAO — SSO — RAM-A — SPINNERET) all the way down to the cover term. Since it’s not
necessary to have a normalized number or administrative region populated, the numbers in the Org View will be higher than
the numbers in the Map View.

(U//FOUO) Similarity View — The Similarity View is currently a placeholder view for an upcoming feature that will
graphically display sites that are similar in nature. This can be used to identify areas for a de-duplication effort or to inform
analysts of additional SIGADs to task for queries (similar to Amazon’s “if you like this item, you’ll also like these” feature).

(U) Where do you get your data?

(U//FOUO) BOUNDLESSINFORMANT extracts metadata records from GM-PLACE post-FALLOUT (DNI ingest processor)
and post-TUSKATTIRE (DNR ingest processor). The records are enriched with organization information (e.g. SSO,
FORNSAT) and cover term. Every valid DNI and DNR metadata record is aggregated to provide a count at the appropriate
level. See the different views question above for additional information.

(U) Do you have all the data? What data is missing?

0 (U//FOUO) The tool resides on GM-PLACE which is only accredited up to TS//SI//NOFORN. Therefore, the tool
does not contain ECI or FISA data.

0 (U//FOUO) The Map View only shows counts for records with a valid normalized number (DNR) or administrative
region atom (DNI).

o (U//FOUO) Only metadata records that are sent back to NSA—W through FASCIA or FALLOUT are counted.
Therefore, programs with a distributed data distribution system (e.g. MUSCULAR and Terrestrial RF) are not
currently counted.

- (U//FOUO) Only SIGINT records are currently counted. There are no ELINT or other “INT” records included.

(U) Why are you showing metadata record counts versus content?

(U//FOUO)

(U) Do you distinguish between sustained collect and survey collect?

(U//FOUO) The tool currently makes no distinction between sustained collect and survey collect. This feature is on the
roadmap.

What is the technical architecture for the tool?

(U//FOUO) DNI metadata (ASDF), DNR metadata (FASCIA) delivered to Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
on GM-PLACE

- (U//FOUO) Use Java MapReduce job to transform/ﬁlter and enrich FASCIA/ASDF data with business logic to
assign organization rules to data

0 (U//FOUO) Bulk import of DNI/DNR data (serialized Google Protobuﬁ objects) into Cloudbase (enabled by custom
aggregators)

0 (U//FOUO) Use Java web app (hosted via Tomcat) on MachineShop (formerly TurkeyTower) to query Cloudbase

0 (U//FOUO) GUI triggers queries to CloudBase — GXT (ExtGWT)

What are some upcoming features/enhancements?
