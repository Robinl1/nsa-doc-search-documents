VALIDATUR

VALIDATDR is a part of a backdoor access system under the FDKPLCID project. The
VALIDATDR is a clienﬂserver—hased system that provides unique backdoor access to
personal computers of targets of national interest, including but not limited to terrorist
targets. VALIDATDR is a small Trojan implant used as a back door against a variety of
targeted Windows systems, which can be deployed remotely or via hands on access to
any Windows boat from Windows 98 through Windows Server EDGE-i. The LP is on-line
24!? and tasking is ‘queued’, that is+ johs sit in a queue waiting for the target to ‘call
home’, then the joh(s) are sent one at a time to the target for it to process them.
Commands are For a file, get a file, Put. then execute a file. get system information.
change VALIDATDR 1D, and Remove itself. VALIDHTGR’s are deployed to targeted
systems and contact their Listening Post {LP} (each ‘v'PLLlDATDR is given a specific
unique ID, specific IP address to call home to it’s LP); SEPI analysts validate the target’s
identity and location [USSIDulEi check], then provide a deployment list to Olympus
operators to load a more sophisticated Trojan implant (currently OLYMPUS, future
UNITEDRAKE}. An OLYMPUS operator then queue up commands for the Specific
VALIDATDR ID’s given lay SEPI. Process repeats itself. Dnce target is hooked with the
more sophisticated implant, VALIDATDR operators tend to cease. [in occasion,
operators are instructed by SEPI or the 5WD to have Vi‘tIDATDR delete itself.
