BACKGROUND (U)

(T S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) A previous SIGINT assessment report on
radicalization indicated that radicalizers appear to be particularly vulnerable in the area
of authority when their private and public behaviors are not consistent. (A) Some of the
vulnerabilities, if exposed, would likely call into question a radicalizer's devotion to the
jihadist cause, leading to the degradation or loss of his authority. Examples of some of
these vulnerabilities include:

0 Viewing sexually explicit material online or using sexually explicit persuasive
language when communicating with inexperienced young girls;

. Using a portion of the donations they are receiving from the susceptible pool to
defray their own personal expenses;

- Charging an exorbitant amount of money for their speaking fees and being
singularly attracted by opportunities to increase their stature; or

0 Being known to base their public messaging on questionable sources or using
language that is contradictory in nature, leaving them open to credibility
challenges.

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Issues of trust and reputation are important when
considering the validity and appeal of the message. It stands to reason that exploiting
vulnerabilities of character, credibility, or both, of the radicalizer and his message could
be enhanced by an understanding of the vehicles he uses to disseminate his message to
the susceptible pool of people and where he is vulnerable in terms of access.
