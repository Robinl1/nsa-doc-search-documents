(TSIISIIKNFJ 550 HIGHLIGHT - BLARNEY Exploits the Social
Network via Expanded Facebook Collection

lTS/fSIffNF) On 11 March 2311,

  

DPIs are
excited about receiving many content fields. such as chat,
on a sustained basis that had previously only been
occasionally available. Some content will be completely new
including subscriber videos. Taken together, the new
Facebook collection will provide a robust SIGINT
opportunity against our targets — from geolocation based on
their IP addresses and user agent, to collection of all of
their private messages and profile information. Multiple
elements across NSA partnered to ensure the successful
delivery of this data. An NSA representative at FBI
coordinated the rapid development of the collection system:
550's PRINTAURA team wrote new software and made
configuration changes; CES modified their protocol
exploitation systems and the Technology Directorate fast-
tracked upgrades to their data presentation tools so that
OPIs could view the data properly.
