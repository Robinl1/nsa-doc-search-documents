(TS/lSl/JNF) Not all SIGINT tradecraft involves accessing signals and
networks from thousands of miles away... In fact, sometimes it is very - ‘
hands—on (literallyl). Here’s how it works: shipments of computer network "
devices (servers, routers, etc.) being delivered to our targets throughout the world are
intercepted. Next, they are redirected to a secret location where Tailored Access
Operations/Access Operations (A0 — 8326) employees, with the support of the Remote
Operations Center (S321 ), enable the installation ofbencon implants directly into our
targets” electronic devices. These devices are then re-packaged and placed back into
transit to the original destination. All of this happens with the support of Intelligence
Community partners and the technical wizards in TAO.
