{TSf/SII/NF} New Skype Stored Comms Capability For PRISM

 

By [ NAME REvoTED ] on 2013—94—93 @631

 

{TS//SI//NF) PRISM has a new collection capability: Skype stored
communications. Skype stored communications will contain unique data which
is not collected via normal real—time surveillance collection. SSO expects
to receive buddy lists, credit card info, call data records, user account
info. and other material. On 29 March 2813, SSO forwarded approximately 2008
Skype selectors for stored communications to be adjudicated in SV41 and the
Electronic Communications Surveillance Unit (ECSU) at FBI. sv41 had been
working on adjudication for the highest priority selectors ahead of time and
had about 103 ready for ECSU to evaluate. It could take several weeks for
SU41 to work through all 2660 selectors to get them approved. and ECSU will
likely take longer to grant the approvals. As of 2 April, ESCU had approved
over 30 selectors to be sent to Skype for collection. PRISM Skype collection
has carved out a vital niche in NSA reporting in less than two years with
terrorism, Syrian opposition and regime, and exec/special series reports
being the top topics. Over 2880 reports have been issued since April 2811
based on PRISM Skype collection, with 76% of them being single source.
