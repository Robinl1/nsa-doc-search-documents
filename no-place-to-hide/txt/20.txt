(TSI/SI/INF) On Thursday, 11/5/09, the SSO—OAKSTAR
SILVERZEPHYR (SZ) access began forwarding FAA DNI records
to NSAW via the FAA WealthyCluster2/Tellurian system
installed at the partner's site. 550 coordinated with the
Data Flow Office and forwarded numerous sample files to a
test partition for validation, which was completely
successful. $50 will continue to monitor the flow and
collection to ensure a ny anomalies are identified and
corrected as required. SILVERZEPHYR will continue to
provide customers with authorized, transit DNR collection.
550 is working with the partner to gain access to an
additional 806bs of DNI data on their peering network,
bundled in 10 Gbs increments. The OAKSTAR team, along with
support from NSAT and GNDA, just completed a 12 day SIGINT
survey at site, which identified over 200 new links. During
the survey, GNDA worked with the partner to test the output
of their ACS system. OAKSTAR is also working with NSAT to
examine snapshots taken by the partner in Brazil and
Colombia, both of which may contain internal communications
for those countries.
