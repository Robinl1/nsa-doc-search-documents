(TS/ISII/NF) On 31 July, Microsoft (MS) began encrypting web—based chat
with the introduction of the new outlook.com service. This new Secure
Socket Layer (SSL) encryption effectively cut off collection of the new
service for FAA 702 and likely 12333 (to some de ree) for the Intelligence
Community (IC).

 

The SSL solution was applied to all
current FISA and 702/PRISM requirements - no changes to UTT tasking
procedures were required. The SSL solution does not collect server—based
voice/video or file transfers. The MS legacy collection system will remain
in place to collect voice/video and file transfers. As a result there will
be some duplicate collection of text—based chat from the new and legacy
systems which will be addressed at a later date. An increase in collection
volume as a result of this solution has already been noted by CES.
