(TS/{SI/INF) SSO HIGHLIGHT — Microsoft Skydrive Collection Now Part of
PRISM Standard Stored Communications Collection

By NAME REDACTED on 2013—33—08 1553

(TS/{SI/INF) Beginning on 7 March 2313, PRISM now collects Microsoft
Skydrive data as part of PRISM's standard Stored Communications collection
package for a tasked FISA Amendments Act Section 782 (FAAIGZ) selector.
This means that analysts will no longer have to make a special request to
350 for this — a process step that many analysts may not have known about.
This new capability will result in a much more complete and timely
collection response from 550 for our Enterprise customers. This success is
the result of the FBI working for many months with Microsoft to get this
tasking and collection solution established. "SkyDrive is a cloud service
that allows users to store and access their files on a variety of devices.
The utility also includes free web app support for Microsoft Office
programs, so the user is able to create, edit, and view Word, PowerPoint,
Excel files without having MS Office actually installed on their device."
