two-week target development surge effort against one of Mexico's
leading presidential candidates, Enrique Pena Nieto, and nine of his
close associates. Nieto is considered by most political pundits to be
the likely winner of the 2012 Mexican presidential elections which are
to be held in July 2012. SATC leveraged graph analysis in the
