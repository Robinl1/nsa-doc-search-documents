[ﬂ] (TS/lSI/IREL) Malicious foreign actor == disseminator of US data?

Can we treat a foreign server who stores, or potentially disseminates leaked or stolen US data on it's server
as a 'malicious foreign actor' for the purpose of targeting with no defeats? Examples: WikiLeaks,

thepiratebay.org, etc.

NOC/OGC RESPONSE: Let us get back to you. (Source #001)

[Q] (TS/lSI/IREL) Unknowingly targeting a US person

I screwed up...the selector had a strong indication of being foreign, but it turned out to be US...now
what?

NOC/OGC RESPONSE: With all querying, if you discover it actually is US, then it must be submitted and
go in the OGC quarterly report...— (Source #001)
