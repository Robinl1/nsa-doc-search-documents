CES/SSC/AAD VPN “Surge”

Speciol Collection Service

 

- Main Goal:

— To evaluate SCS VPN access and analysis to determine better methods
of identifying and exploiting networks of interest.

- Two Focuses:
— What can we do with VPN data that is already ingested into the system?

- Find better methods of reporting VPN stats and exploitation
determinations from CES back to SSC and site.

— ’Are there methods to better identify and survey VPN’s to provide CES
the data they need?

- Can we leverage MIRROR, D'ARKQUEST, PANOPLY survey
information to quickly identify and report the presence of VPN’s in
surveyed signals?

- Can we use BIRDWATCHER or other means to automatically
resurvey for key exchanges and obtain paired collect?
